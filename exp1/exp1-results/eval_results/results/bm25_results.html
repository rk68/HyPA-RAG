This data is used to evaluate the tool&#x27;s performance and identify any biases.\\n2. **Test Data**: If historical data is insufficient for a statistically significant bias audit, test data may be used. The summary of the bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data was generated and obtained.\\n\\n### Process of Assessing the Impact of an AEDT:\\n1. **Impact Ratio Calculation**: The first step is to calculate the impact ratio for each category. This involves analyzing the AEDT&#x27;s decisions to determine if there are disparities in outcomes across different groups.\\n2. **Separate Calculations for Categories**: The impact assessment must separately address the impact on sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race. This ensures a comprehensive evaluation of the AEDT&#x27;s impact on various demographic groups.\\n3. **Unknown Categories**: The assessment must also indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT who are not included in the required calculations because they fall within an unknown category.\\n\\n### Relationship:\\n- **Data Utilization**: Both processes rely on the same data sources (historical or test data) to perform their respective analyses.\\n- **Comprehensive Analysis**: The bias audit&#x27;s data requirements ensure that sufficient and appropriate data is available to perform a detailed impact assessment on different categories.\\n- **Transparency and Explanation**: Both processes require transparency in data usage and methodology, ensuring that any limitations or deviations (such as the use of test data) are clearly explained.\\n\\nIn summary, the data requirements for a bias audit provide the foundation for assessing the impact of an AEDT on different categories, ensuring that the analysis is thorough, transparent, and based on reliable data.","1. **Where can a proceeding to recover a civil penalty be returnable?**\\n   - A proceeding to recover a civil penalty can be returnable to any tribunal established within the office of administrative trials and hearings or within any agency of the city designated to conduct such proceedings.\\n\\n2. **Who has the authority to initiate an action or proceeding for correction of any violation?**\\n   - The corporation counsel or such other persons designated by the corporation counsel on behalf of the department have the authority to initiate an action or proceeding for correction of any violation.","An **automated employment decision tool** is defined as any computational process derived from machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence that issues simplified outputs, such as scores, classifications, or recommendations.

It requires a detailed explanation of why historical data was not used and how the test data was generated and obtained.\\n  \\n- **Requirements for a Bias Audit**: These typically involve using historical data from previous operations or other employers to conduct a statistically significant audit. The audit relies on existing data to identify and measure bias.","### Definitions\\n\\n**Selection Rate:**\\n- **Definition:** The rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to move forward in a process (such as hiring) or assigned a classification by an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT).\\n- **Calculation:** It is calculated by dividing the number of individuals in the category who move forward or are assigned a classification by the total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.\\n\\n**Scoring Rate:**\\n- **Definition:** The rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above the sample\\u2019s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT.\\n\\n### Similarities\\n1. **Purpose:** Both metrics are used to evaluate the performance and fairness of processes involving selection and scoring, often in the context of employment or promotions.\\n2. **Category-Based:** Both rates are calculated based on specific categories of individuals, such as demographic groups.\\n3. **Use of AEDT:** Both involve the use of Automated Employment Decision Tools (AEDTs) to either assign classifications or calculate scores.\\n\\n### Differences\\n1. **Focus:**\\n   - **Selection Rate:** Focuses on the proportion of individuals who move forward in a process or are assigned a classification.\\n   - **Scoring Rate:** Focuses on the proportion of individuals who receive a score above the median score in a sample.\\n   \\n2. **Calculation Basis:**\\n   - **Selection Rate:** Based on the total number of individuals in a category who applied or were considered.\\n   - **Scoring Rate:** Based on the scores calculated by an AEDT and the median score of the sample.\\n\\n### Relationship\\n- **Interdependence:** While the selection rate and scoring rate are distinct metrics, they can be related. For example, a high scoring rate in a particular category might lead to a higher selection rate if the selection process heavily relies on the scores provided by the AEDT.\\n- **Evaluation:** Both rates can be used together to evaluate the fairness and effectiveness of the selection process. Discrepancies between the two rates across different categories might indicate potential biases or areas for improvement in the AEDT or the selection process.","### Calculations Required in a Bias Audit\\n\\n1. **Selection Rate Calculation**:\\n   - Calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category as required by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).\\n   - Compare these rates to the most selected category to determine an impact ratio.\\n\\n2. **Scoring Calculations** (if applicable):\\n   - If the Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT) scores candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion:\\n     - Calculate the median score for the full sample of applicants.\\n     - Calculate the scoring rate for individuals in each category.\\n\\n### Exclusion of Categories by Independent Auditor\\n\\nAn independent auditor can exclude a category from the bias audit calculations if:\\n\\n- The category represents less than 2% of the data being used for the bias audit.\\n\\nThe summary of results must include:\\n\\n- The auditor\\u2019s justification for the exclusion.\\n- The number of applicants.\\n- The scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded category.","The relationship between the definition of test data and when an employer or employment agency can rely on a bias audit that uses test data is as follows:\\n\\n- **Definition of Test Data**: Test data is data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.\\n\\n- **Reliance on Bias Audit Using Test Data**: An employer or employment agency can rely on a bias audit that uses test data if there is insufficient historical data available to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. The summary of results of the bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data was generated and obtained.\\n\\nIn essence, test data is an alternative to historical data for conducting bias audits, and it can be used when historical data is inadequate.","The relationship between the calculations in a bias audit of an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT) and the requirements for the published results is that the calculations are designed to ensure that the published results accurately reflect any potential biases in the selection process. Specifically, the calculations involve determining the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category, and comparing these rates to identify any disparities.\\n\\nHowever, the calculations in a bias audit differ from the requirements for the published results in that the audit calculations must include detailed metrics such as the median score for the full sample of applicants and the scoring rate for individuals in each category. In contrast, the published results may not include data on certain individuals, focusing instead on aggregated data that highlights any significant biases identified during the audit.","The relationship between the calculations required for a bias audit and the exclusion of categories from the impact ratio can be understood as follows:\\n\\n1. **Calculations Required for a Bias Audit**:\\n   - A bias audit involves calculating the selection rates for each race/ethnicity and sex category as reported to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).\\n   - These selection rates are then compared to the selection rate of the most selected category to determine the impact ratio.\\n\\n2. **Impact Ratio**:\\n   - The impact ratio is a measure used to compare the selection or scoring rates between different categories.\\n   - It is calculated by dividing the selection rate (or scoring rate) for a specific category by the selection rate (or scoring rate) of the most selected (or highest scoring) category.\\n\\n3. **Exclusion of Categories**:\\n   - Certain categories might be excluded from the impact ratio if they represent less than 2% of the data used for the audit.\\n   - This exclusion is intended to prevent very small sample sizes from disproportionately affecting the impact ratio calculations.\\n   - When a category is excluded, the independent auditor must provide a justification for the exclusion, along with the number of applicants and the scoring or selection rate for the excluded category.\\n\\nIn summary, the calculations for a bias audit involve determining selection rates and comparing them to derive the impact ratio. However, to ensure the reliability of these calculations, categories with very small sample sizes (less than 2% of the data) may be excluded, with proper justification provided by the auditor.","### Requirements for Using an Automated Employment Decision Tool\\n\\nThe provided context does not include specific requirements associated with using an automated employment decision tool.
