For example, if the selection rate for male candidates is 60% and for female candidates is 40%, the impact ratio for female candidates would be 40% / 60% = 0.67.\\n\\n3. **Assess the Impact Separately for Different Categories:**\\n   - **Sex Categories:** Calculate the impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs. female candidates.\\n   - **Race/Ethnicity Categories:** Calculate the impact ratio for selection of different racial or ethnic groups (e.g., Hispanic or Latino candidates vs. Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates).\\n   - **Intersectional Categories:** Calculate the impact ratio for intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American female candidates).\\n\\n4. **Indicate the Number of Individuals in Unknown Categories:**\\n   - Report the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT who are not included in the required calculations because they fall within an unknown category.\\n\\n5. **Exclusion of Small Categories:**\\n   - An independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. The summary of results must include the justification for the exclusion and the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded category.\\n\\nBy following these steps, auditors can ensure that the AEDT is evaluated for potential biases and that the impact on different demographic groups is properly assessed.","An &#x27;automated employment decision tool&#x27; is defined as any computational process that uses machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence to produce simplified outputs like scores, classifications, or recommendations.

The requirements ensure that the audit is based on real-world data and scenarios, providing a more accurate assessment of potential biases.","### Definitions\\n\\n**Selection Rate:**\\n- **Definition:** The rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to move forward in a process (such as hiring) or assigned a classification by an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT).\\n- **Calculation:** It is calculated by dividing the number of individuals in the category who move forward or are assigned a classification by the total number of individuals in the category who applied or were considered.\\n\\n**Scoring Rate:**\\n- **Definition:** The rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above the sample\\u2019s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT.\\n- **Calculation:** It is determined by the proportion of individuals in a category who score above the median score of the sample.\\n\\n### Similarities\\n1. **Use in Evaluation:** Both metrics are used to evaluate the performance or progression of individuals within a specific category.\\n2. **Dependence on AEDT:** Both rates can be influenced by the scoring or classification provided by an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT).\\n3. **Categorical Analysis:** Both rates analyze individuals based on their belonging to a specific category (e.g., demographic group, job applicants).\\n\\n### Differences\\n1. **Focus:**\\n   - **Selection Rate:** Focuses on the proportion of individuals who move forward in a process or are assigned a classification.\\n   - **Scoring Rate:** Focuses on the proportion of individuals who score above the median score in a sample.\\n   \\n2. **Outcome Measurement:**\\n   - **Selection Rate:** Measures progression or classification assignment.\\n   - **Scoring Rate:** Measures scoring performance relative to the median score.\\n\\n### Relationship\\n- **Interdependence:** A high scoring rate in a category could potentially influence the selection rate if the selection process is based on scores. For instance, if individuals with scores above the median are more likely to be selected, then a higher scoring rate could lead to a higher selection rate.\\n- **Sequential Use:** In some processes, scoring might be the first step (to filter candidates), followed by selection based on those scores. Thus, scoring rate can be a precursor to selection rate.\\n\\nUnderstanding both metrics is crucial for evaluating fairness and effectiveness in processes like hiring, promotions, and other decision-making scenarios involving AEDTs.","The bias audit requires the following calculations:\\n\\n1. **Selection Rate Calculation**: Calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category that is required to be reported to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).\\n2. **Impact Ratio Calculation**: Compare the selection rates to the most selected category to determine an impact ratio.\\n3. **Median Score Calculation**: Calculate the median score for the full sample of applicants.\\n4. **Scoring Rate Calculation**: Calculate the scoring rate for individuals in each category.\\n\\nAn independent auditor can exclude a category from the bias audit calculations if the category represents less than 2% of the data being used for the bias audit. The summary of results must include the independent auditor\\u2019s justification for the exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and the scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded category.","The relationship between the definition of test data and when an employer or employment agency can rely on a bias audit that uses test data is as follows:\\n\\n- **Definition of Test Data**: Test data is data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.\\n\\n- **Reliance on Bias Audit Using Test Data**: An employer or employment agency can rely on a bias audit that uses test data if there is insufficient historical data available to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. The summary of results of the bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data was generated and obtained.\\n\\nIn essence, test data is an alternative to historical data used in bias audits when historical data is inadequate, and its use must be justified and explained in the audit results.","The relationship between the calculations in a bias audit of an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT) and the requirements for the published results is that the calculations are designed to ensure that the published results accurately reflect any potential biases in the selection process. Specifically, the calculations involve determining the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category and comparing these rates to the most selected category to determine an impact ratio. This process is mandated by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission&#x27;s EEO Component 1 report.\\n\\nThe difference lies in the specific focus of the calculations versus the requirements for the published results. In the bias audit, the calculations must include determining the median score for the full sample of applicants and calculating the scoring rate for individuals in each category. These calculations are essential to the audit process to ensure fairness and identify any potential biases in the scoring system. The published results, on the other hand, must reflect these findings and demonstrate compliance with the required standards, ensuring transparency and accountability in the selection process.","The relationship between the calculations required for a bias audit and the exclusion of categories from the impact ratio can be understood as follows:\\n\\n1. **Calculations Required for a Bias Audit**:\\n   - A bias audit involves calculating the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category that must be reported to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report.\\n   - These selection rates are then compared to the most selected category to determine an impact ratio.\\n\\n2. **Impact Ratio**:\\n   - The impact ratio is a measure used to compare the selection or scoring rates between different categories.\\n   - It is calculated by dividing the selection rate for a specific category by the selection rate of the most selected category, or by dividing the scoring rate for a specific category by the scoring rate of the highest scoring category.\\n\\n3. **Exclusion of Categories from the Impact Ratio**:\\n   - Categories might be excluded from the impact ratio if they represent less than 2% of the data being used for the audit.\\n   - This exclusion requires the independent auditor to provide a justification for the exclusion and include the number of applicants and the scoring or selection rate for the excluded category in the summary of results.\\n\\nIn summary, the calculations for a bias audit involve determining selection rates and comparing them to derive the impact ratio. However, if certain categories are underrepresented (less than 2% of the data), they may be excluded from the impact ratio calculation, with proper justification and documentation provided by the auditor.","### Requirements for Using an Automated Employment Decision Tool\\n\\nThe provided context does not include specific requirements associated with using an automated employment decision tool.
