This is to ensure that the tool does not result in unfair discrimination against any group, thereby complying with federal regulations.\\n\\nIn essence, the definition outlines what the tool is and its purpose, while the requirements ensure that its use is fair, transparent, and legally compliant.","The relationship between test data and the requirements for a bias audit is that test data can be used as a substitute when historical data is insufficient to achieve statistically significant results. Here are the key points of differentiation and relationship:\\n\\n1. **Purpose**:\\n   - **Test Data**: Used to simulate scenarios and outcomes when historical data is not available or insufficient.\\n   - **Bias Audit Requirements**: Typically involve using historical data to assess the presence of bias in a system.\\n\\n2. **Usage**:\\n   - **Test Data**: Employed when historical data from employers or employment agencies is lacking or inadequate.\\n   - **Bias Audit Requirements**: Prefer the use of historical data to ensure the audit reflects real-world usage and outcomes.\\n\\n3. **Transparency**:\\n   - **Test Data**: When used, the audit must include an explanation of why historical data was not used and detail how the test data was generated and obtained.\\n   - **Bias Audit Requirements**: Focus on using actual historical data to provide a more accurate and reliable assessment of bias.\\n\\n4. **Context**:\\n   - **Test Data**: Provides an alternative means to conduct a bias audit, ensuring that the audit can still proceed even in the absence of sufficient historical data.\\n   - **Bias Audit Requirements**: Aim to use the most relevant and accurate data available to assess bias, which is typically historical data.\\n\\nIn summary, while test data serves as an alternative when historical data is not available, the requirements for a bias audit generally prioritize the use of historical data to ensure the audit&#x27;s findings are based on real-world evidence.","### Definitions\\n\\n**Selection Rate:**\\n- **Definition:** The rate at which individuals in a specific category are either selected to move forward in a process (e.g., hiring) or assigned a classification by an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT).\\n- **Calculation:** \\n  \\\\[\\n  \\\\text{Selection Rate} = \\\\frac{\\\\text{Number of individuals selected}}{\\\\text{Total number of individuals in the category}}\\n  \\\\]\\n  For example, if 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview, the selection rate for Hispanic women would be 40%.\\n\\n**Scoring Rate:**\\n- **Definition:** The rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above the sample\\u2019s median score, where the score is calculated by an AEDT.\\n- **Calculation:** \\n  \\\\[\\n  \\\\text{Scoring Rate} = \\\\frac{\\\\text{Number of individuals scoring above the median}}{\\\\text{Total number of individuals in the category}}\\n  \\\\]\\n\\n### Similarities\\n1. **Purpose:** Both metrics are used to evaluate the performance and fairness of AEDTs in employment-related decisions.\\n2. **Category-Based:** Both rates are calculated for specific categories of individuals (e.g., by gender, ethnicity).\\n3. **Numerical Representation:** Both are expressed as percentages.\\n\\n### Differences\\n1. **Focus:**\\n   - **Selection Rate:** Focuses on the proportion of individuals who move forward in a process or are assigned a classification.\\n   - **Scoring Rate:** Focuses on the proportion of individuals who score above the median score.\\n2. **Calculation Basis:**\\n   - **Selection Rate:** Based on the number of individuals selected out of the total who applied or were considered.\\n   - **Scoring Rate:** Based on the number of individuals scoring above the median out of the total who were scored.\\n\\n### Relationship\\n- **Interdependence:** While the selection rate and scoring rate are distinct metrics, they can be related. A high scoring rate in a category might lead to a higher selection rate if the selection process favors those with higher scores.\\n- **Evaluation:** Both metrics can be used together to assess the fairness and effectiveness of AEDTs. For instance, if a particular category has a low selection rate but a high scoring rate, it may indicate a bias in the selection process despite the scoring system.\\n\\nUnderstanding both metrics helps in making informed decisions about the use and impact of AEDTs in employment processes.","The bias audit requires the following calculations:\\n\\n1. **Selection Rate**: This is calculated by dividing the number of selected applicants by the total number of applicants for each sex category.\\n2. **Impact Ratio**: This is determined by comparing the selection rates of different sex categories, typically by dividing the selection rate of one category by the selection rate of the category with the highest selection rate.\\n\\nAn independent auditor can exclude a category from the bias audit calculations if the category represents less than 2% of the data being used for the bias audit. The summary of results must include the independent auditor\\u2019s justification for the exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and the scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded category.","The relationship between the definition of test data and when an employer or employment agency can rely on a bias audit that uses test data is as follows:\\n\\n- **Definition of Test Data**: Test data is data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.\\n\\n- **Reliance on Bias Audit Using Test Data**: An employer or employment agency can rely on a bias audit that uses test data if there is insufficient historical data available to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. The summary of results of the bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data was generated and obtained.\\n\\nIn essence, test data serves as an alternative to historical data when the latter is insufficient for a meaningful bias audit.","The relationship between the calculations in a bias audit of an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT) and the requirements for the published results is that both are aimed at ensuring transparency and fairness in the use of AEDTs. The calculations must separately assess the impact on various categories, including sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race. Additionally, the audit must indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT who fall within an unknown category.\\n\\nThe requirements for the published results differ in that if a category represents less than 2% of the data, it can be excluded from the calculations. However, the summary of results must include the independent auditor&#x27;s justification for the exclusion and the number of applicants and their scoring or selection rate for the excluded category. This ensures that even small categories are accounted for and that any exclusions are transparently justified.","The relationship between the calculations required for the bias audit and the exclusion of categories from the impact ratio is as follows:\\n\\n1. **Bias Audit Calculations**: These involve determining the impact ratio for various categories such as sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectional categories. The impact ratio is a measure used to identify potential biases in the selection or scoring processes.\\n\\n2. **Exclusion of Categories**: An independent auditor may exclude a category from the impact ratio calculations if it represents less than 2% of the data used for the bias audit. This exclusion is to ensure that the analysis is statistically significant and not skewed by very small sample sizes.\\n\\n3. **Justification and Reporting**: When a category is excluded, the auditor must provide a justification for the exclusion and report the number of applicants and their scoring or selection rate for the excluded category. This ensures transparency and accountability in the bias audit process.\\n\\nIn summary, the exclusion of categories from the impact ratio is a part of the bias audit process to maintain the integrity and relevance of the analysis, especially when dealing with very small sample sizes.","When using an automated employment decision tool, employers or employment agencies must adhere to the following requirements:\\n\\n1. **Bias Audit**: The tool must undergo a bias audit within the past year.\\n2. **Public Disclosure**: A summary of the audit results must be made publicly available on the employer&#x27;s or agency&#x27;s website.\\n3. **Notification**: Candidates or employees must be notified at least ten business days in advance about:\\n   - The use of the automated tool.\\n   - The job qualifications and characteristics that the tool will assess.\\n4. **Data Policies**: Upon written request, information on data collection and retention policies must be provided to candidates or employees.\\n\\n### Penalties for Non-Compliance:\\n- **First Violation**: A civil penalty of up to $500.\\n- **Subsequent Violations**: A civil penalty between $500 and $1,500 for each additional violation.\\n- **Daily Violations**: Each day of non-compliance and each failure to provide required notices constitutes a separate violation.\\n\\nProceedings to recover penalties are managed by designated city tribunals or agencies.","The relationship between an automated employment decision tool and the requirements for using it is centered around ensuring transparency, fairness, and compliance with legal standards.

However, I can provide general definitions for both terms in the context of sports:\\n\\n### Scoring Rate\\n**Definition in Sports:**\\n- **Scoring Rate** typically refers to the frequency at which a player or team scores points or goals in a game or over a series of games. It is often expressed as points per game, goals per match, or runs per over (in cricket), etc.\\n\\n### Screen\\n**Definition in Sports:**\\n- **Screen** in sports usually refers to a tactic used to block or impede an opponent&#x27;s movement or view. For example, in basketball, a screen (or pick) is set by a player to free a teammate from a defender. In ice hockey, a screen is used to obstruct the goaltender&#x27;s view of the puck.\\n\\n### Similarities:\\n1. **Contextual Use**: Both terms are used within the context of sports to describe specific actions or metrics.\\n2. **Performance Impact**: Both can significantly impact the performance and outcome of a game. A high scoring rate can lead to winning games, while effective screens can create scoring opportunities.\\n\\n### Differences:\\n1. **Nature**: \\n   - **Scoring Rate** is a statistical measure of performance.\\n   - **Screen** is a tactical maneuver used during gameplay.\\n2. **Application**:\\n   - **Scoring Rate** is used to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of scoring.\\n   - **Screen** is used to create strategic advantages during play.\\n\\n### Relationship:\\n- **Interdependence**: Effective screens can directly influence the scoring rate by creating better scoring opportunities for players. For example, in basketball, a well-executed screen can free up a shooter, potentially increasing the team&#x27;s scoring rate.\\n\\nWould you like more detailed information on either term within a specific sport?","The relationship between the definition of &#x27;Automated Employment Decision Tool&#x27; and the requirement for using such a tool in the city is as follows:\\n\\n1. **Definition**: An &#x27;Automated Employment Decision Tool&#x27; is defined as a computational process that uses machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence to assist or replace discretionary decision-making in employment decisions.\\n\\n2. **Requirements**: \\n   - **Bias Audit**: The tool must undergo a bias audit within the past year.\\n   - **Transparency**: The results of the bias audit and the tool&#x27;s distribution date must be publicly available on the employer&#x27;s or employment agency&#x27;s website.\\n   - **Notification**: Employers or employment agencies must notify candidates or employees residing in the city that such a tool will be used in their assessment or evaluation.\\n\\nThe requirements ensure that the use of such tools is transparent, fair, and non-discriminatory, aligning with the defined purpose of assisting or replacing discretionary decision-making in employment.","The term \\"employment decision\\" refers to the process of screening candidates for employment or employees for promotion within a city.\\n\\nTo use an automated employment decision tool, several requirements must be met:\\n\\n1. **Bias Audit**: The tool must have undergone a bias audit within the past year.\\n2. **Public Disclosure**: A summary of the most recent bias audit results and the distribution date of the tool must be publicly available on the employer or employment agency&#x27;s website before using the tool.\\n\\nAdditionally, employers or employment agencies must notify candidates or employees residing in the city of the following:\\n\\n1. **Notification of Use**: Inform candidates that an automated employment decision tool will be used at least ten business days before its use, allowing them to request an alternative selection process or accommodation.\\n2. **Job Qualifications and Characteristics**: Provide information on the job qualifications and characteristics the tool will use in the assessment at least ten business days before its use.\\n3. **Data Information**: Disclose information about the type of data collected, the source of the data, and the data retention policy.

While both concepts involve making assessments, &#x27;Scoring Rate&#x27; focuses on evaluating scores based on a median, while &#x27;Screen&#x27; involves evaluating candidates for selection or promotion. They are related in the sense that both involve making judgments or decisions based on certain criteria, but they differ in terms of the specific context and method of assessment.","The definition of &#x27;Automated Employment Decision Tool&#x27; refers to a computational process that assists or replaces discretionary decision making in employment decisions. In the city, it is unlawful to use such a tool to screen candidates or employees unless it has undergone a bias audit within the past year. The requirement ensures that the use of these tools is regulated and monitored for fairness and non-discrimination.","The term &#x27;employment decision&#x27; refers to the screening of candidates for employment or employees for promotion within the city. In relation to this, the requirements for using an automated employment decision tool state that it shall be unlawful to use such a tool unless it has been the subject of a bias audit conducted no more than one year prior to its use. Therefore, the definition of &#x27;employment decision&#x27; sets the context for understanding the requirements that must be met when using an automated employment decision tool.","The requirements for a bias audit involve calculating selection rates for different demographic categories to determine an impact ratio. Test data, on the other hand, refers to the data used in a bias audit that is not historical data. Test data is necessary to conduct a bias audit and apply the requirements. In summary, the requirements for a bias audit rely on analyzing selection rates, while test data is the specific type of data used to perform the audit.","The purpose of a bias audit is to calculate the impact ratio for each category and ensure non-discriminatory impact. An employer can rely on a bias audit that uses test data when there is insufficient historical data available to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. In other words, the purpose of the bias audit informs the circumstances in which an employer can use test data for the audit.","&#x27;Automated employment decision tool&#x27; refers to an automated tool used for making employment decisions, as defined by \\u00a7 20-870 of the Code. Similarly, &#x27;bias audit&#x27; refers to a specific type of audit conducted to assess bias, also defined by \\u00a7 20-870 of the Code. Both terms are defined within the same section of the Code, indicating a relationship between the concepts in the context of employment decision-making and bias assessment.","An automated employment decision tool refers to a computational process that simplifies decision-making in employment by using machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. Violating the requirements for such tools can result in civil penalties, with a first violation carrying a maximum penalty of $500 and subsequent violations ranging from $500 to $1,500 per violation on the same day.","An employer or employment agency must provide the date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results on their website. Additionally, they can notify candidates about the use of an AEDT by providing notice on the employment section of their website.","An employer must make the date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results publicly available on the employment section of their website. In contrast, an employer is required to provide notice to candidates for employment via U.S. mail or e-mail at least 10 business days before use of an AEDT. While both requirements aim to ensure transparency and fairness in the use of AEDTs, the information on the website provides ongoing information to the public, while the notice requirement specifically applies to candidates for employment.","In order for an employer in the city of New York to use an automated employment decision tool to screen candidates for a job position, the tool must have been the subject of a bias audit conducted no more than one year prior to its use, and a summary of the results of the most recent bias audit must be made publicly available on the employer&#x27;s website prior to the use of the tool.","No, the employer cannot rely on a bias audit conducted using test data.
