New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection 
 
Notice of Adoption of Final Rule 
 
Pursuant to the authority vested in the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection by 
Sections 1043 and 2203(f) of the New York City Charter and Section 20-104(b) of the New York City 
Administrative Code, and in accordance with the requirements of Section 1043 of the New York City Charter, 
the Department amends Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York.  
 
An initial version of this rule was proposed and published on September 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on 
November 4, 2022, and comments regarding the rule were received. DCWP proposed a second version of this 
rule on December 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on January 23, 2023, and comments regarding the rule 
were received.  
 
Statement of Basis and Purpose 
 
The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP” or “Department”) is adding rules to implement 
new legislation regarding automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”). Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits 
employers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has 
been subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly 
available, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   
 
These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

An automated employment decision tool is defined as any computational process derived from machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence that issues simplified output, such as a score, classification, or recommendation. This output is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons. This definition excludes tools that do not automate, support, substantially assist, or replace discretionary decision-making processes and do not materially impact natural persons, such as junk email filters, firewalls, antivirus software, calculators, spreadsheets, databases, data sets, or other compilations of data.

### Conditions to be Met Before Using an Automated Employment Decision Tool

1. **Bias Audit**: The tool must have undergone a bias audit conducted no more than one year prior to its use.
2. **Public Availability of Audit Results**: A summary of the results of the most recent bias audit, along with the distribution date of the tool to which the audit applies, must be made publicly available on the website of the employer or employment agency.
3. **Notification to Employees or Candidates**: The employer or employment agency must notify each employee or candidate residing in the city at least ten business days before the tool is used, informing them that the tool will be used in their assessment or evaluation.
4. **Job Qualifications and Characteristics**: The notification must include the job qualifications and characteristics that the tool will use in the assessment.
5. **Data Information Disclosure**: If not disclosed on the employer or employment agency’s website, information about the type of data collected, the source of such data, and the data retention policy must be made available upon written request by a candidate or employee within 30 days of the request.",False,"The agent's answer includes additional information about the conditions that need to be met before using an automated employment decision tool, which was not part of the ground truth. The ground truth only required the definition of the tool.",1.0,0.8484848484848485,0.9339330266494996,0.9999999999,5.0,"The generated answer accurately defines an automated employment decision tool and comprehensively outlines the conditions that must be met before its use, aligning closely with the reference answer."
"In the context of a bias audit, what is the definition of 'test data' and when can it be used?",'Test data' refers to data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.,"Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

"As an employer conducting a bias audit, I want to know the threshold for excluding a category from impact ratio calculations.

category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

   b.   Notices required.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex_situational', 'seed_document_id': 23, 'topic': 'Others'}","A **bias audit** for automated employment decision tools is an impartial evaluation conducted by an independent auditor. This audit involves testing the automated tool to assess its disparate impact on individuals based on specific categories that employers are required to report, as outlined in relevant federal regulations.

The purpose of requiring a bias audit in New York City is to ensure that these automated tools are evaluated for potential biases. The audit helps to ensure that the tools do not unfairly impact employment decisions, promoting fairness and transparency in the use of automated systems for employment-related decisions. This requirement aims to protect individuals from discrimination and to foster equitable hiring practices.",True,"The agent's answer correctly explains the purpose of a bias audit for automated employment decision tools, including the assessment of disparate impact and the promotion of fairness and transparency. While it does not cite the specific legal references, it captures the essence of the ground truth answer.",1.0,0.5,0.9446117094323678,0.5833333333041666,4.0,"The generated answer correctly explains the purpose of a bias audit and its importance in evaluating automated employment decision tools, but it lacks specific reference to the legal framework mentioned in the reference answer."
I'm reviewing a policy document and came across the term 'Impact Ratio.' Can you explain what it means and how it is calculated?,"The 'Impact Ratio' can be calculated as either the selection rate for a category divided by the selection rate of the most selected category, or the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the highest scoring category.","Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

financial interest in an employer or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to 
use the  AEDT or in a vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT. 
 
Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.

Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or

New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection 
 
Notice of Adoption of Final Rule 
 
Pursuant to the authority vested in the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection by 
Sections 1043 and 2203(f) of the New York City Charter and Section 20-104(b) of the New York City 
Administrative Code, and in accordance with the requirements of Section 1043 of the New York City Charter, 
the Department amends Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York.  
 
An initial version of this rule was proposed and published on September 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on 
November 4, 2022, and comments regarding the rule were received. DCWP proposed a second version of this 
rule on December 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on January 23, 2023, and comments regarding the rule 
were received.  
 
Statement of Basis and Purpose 
 
The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP” or “Department”) is adding rules to implement 
new legislation regarding automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”). Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits 
employers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has 
been subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly 
available, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   
 
These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

According to the New York City Administrative Code, an **Automated Employment Decision Tool** is defined as:

> Any computational process derived from machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence that issues simplified output, such as a score, classification, or recommendation, which is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons.

This definition excludes tools that do not automate, support, substantially assist, or replace discretionary decision-making processes and do not materially impact natural persons. Examples of such excluded tools are junk email filters, firewalls, antivirus software, calculators, spreadsheets, databases, data sets, or other compilations of data.

### Examples of Usage

An **Automated Employment Decision Tool** can be used in various ways to assist or replace discretionary decision-making in employment processes. Here are some examples:

1. **Resume Screening**: Using machine learning algorithms to rank job candidates based on their resumes. The tool can analyze keywords, experience, and qualifications to provide a score or ranking for each candidate.

2. **Predictive Hiring**: Employing statistical models to predict the success of applicants in specific roles. For instance, a model might analyze past hiring data to forecast which candidates are likely to perform well in a given position.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.

ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex_situational', 'seed_document_id': 6, 'topic': 'Intersectional Categories'}","### Requirements for Conducting a Bias Audit of an AEDT

1. **Selection Rate Calculation**:
   - Calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category as required by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) EEO Component 1 report.
   - The selection rate is the proportion of applicants or employees in a specific category who are selected or scored by the AEDT.

2. **Impact Ratio Determination**:
   - Compare the selection rates of each category to the most selected category to determine an impact ratio.
   - If the AEDT scores candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion, calculate the median score for the full sample of applicants and the scoring rate for individuals in each category.

### Calculation of Impact Ratio

1. **Sex Categories**:
   - **Impact Ratio**: Divide the selection or scoring rate of each sex category by the selection or scoring rate of the category with the highest rate.

2. **Race/Ethnicity Categories**:
   - **Impact Ratio**: Divide the selection or scoring rate of each race/ethnicity category by the selection or scoring rate of the category with the highest rate.

3. **Intersectional Categories**:
   - **Impact Ratio**: Compare the selection or scoring rates of each intersectional group (e.g., race/ethnicity and sex combined) to the highest rate among them.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your AEDT is compliant with bias audit requirements and that you are identifying any potential biases in the tool's decision-making process.",False,"The agent's answer is mostly correct but misses a crucial detail from the ground truth. The ground truth specifies that the audit must indicate the number of individuals not included in the calculations due to falling within an unknown category, which the agent's answer does not mention.",1.0,0.7272727272727273,0.903502640357507,0.9999999999666668,5.0,"The generated answer thoroughly addresses all components of the user query, providing accurate and detailed information on the requirements for conducting a bias audit of an AEDT, including the calculation of impact ratios for various categories without any errors."
I have been using an AEDT for 6 months and need to conduct a bias audit. Can I rely on my own historical data or do I need to provide data from other employers?,"A bias audit of an AEDT must, at a minimum, calculate the selection rate and impact ratio for each category, separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race, perform the calculations for each group if the AEDT classifies candidates into specified groups, and indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT that are not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category.","Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

1. **Selection Rate Calculation**:
   - Calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category as required by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) EEO Component 1 report.

2. **Impact Ratio Comparison**:
   - Compare the selection rates to the most selected category to determine an impact ratio.

3. **Scoring for Employment or Promotion**:
   - For AEDTs that score candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion, the bias audit must:
     - Calculate the median score for the full sample of applicants.
     - Calculate the scoring rate for individuals in each category.

### Calculating Impact Ratios for Different Race/Ethnicity and Sex Categories

1. **Determine the Selection or Scoring Rate for Each Category**:
   - Calculate the selection or scoring rate for each category by dividing the number of individuals selected or scored by the total number of applicants in that category.

2. **Identify the Highest Selection or Scoring Rate**:
   - Find the category with the highest selection or scoring rate. This rate will be used as the benchmark.

3. **Calculate the Impact Ratio**:
   - For each category, divide its selection or scoring rate by the highest selection or scoring rate identified in the previous step. The formula is:
     \[
     \text{Impact Ratio} = \frac{\text{Selection or Scoring Rate of the Category}}{\text{Highest Selection or Scoring Rate}}
     \]

#### Example Calculations

- **Sex Categories**:
  - If the highest scoring rate among sex categories is 54.3% for males, and the scoring rate for females is 44.7%, the impact ratio for females would be:
    \[
    \text{Impact Ratio for Females} = \frac{44.7\%}{54.3\%} = 0.82
    \]

- **Race/Ethnicity Categories**:
  - If the highest scoring rate among race/ethnicity categories is 64.2% for Hispanic or Latino, and the scoring rate for White (Not Hispanic or Latino) is 37.5%, the impact ratio for White (Not Hispanic or Latino) would be:
    \[
    \text{Impact Ratio for White (Not Hispanic or Latino)} = \frac{37.5\%}{64.2\%} = 0.58
    \]

### Race/Ethnicity Categories:
1. **Perform Calculations for Each Category**: Calculate the scoring or selection rates for each race/ethnicity category.
2. **Group Classification**: Ensure calculations are done for each group if the AEDT classifies candidates into specified groups.
3. **Unknown Category**: Indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT who are not included in the required calculations because they fall within an unknown category.

The summary of results must include the auditor’s justification for the exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring or selection rate for the excluded category.

### Sex Categories:
1. **Calculate Impact Ratio for Each Category**: Calculate the impact ratio for each sex category.
2. **Separate Assessments**: Ensure that the calculations separately assess the impact of the AEDT on male candidates versus female candidates.
3. **Applicant and Selection Numbers**: Include the number of applicants and the number selected for each sex category.
4. **Selection Rate**: Determine the selection rate for each sex category.
5. **Comparison**: Compare the selection rates to calculate the impact ratio.

Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and,

What information does the bias audit summary need to include?,"The bias audit summary needs to include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios for all categories.","Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the

Section 1.  Chapter 5 of Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York is amended to add Subchapter T to read 
as follows: 
Subchapter T: Automated Employment Decision Tools 
§ 5-300. Definitions. 
As used in this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings: 
 
Automated Employment Decision Tool. “Automated employment decision tool” or “AEDT” means 
“Automated employment decision tool” as defined by § 20-870 of the Code where the phrase “to 
substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making” means: 
i. 
to rely solely on a simplified output (score, tag, classification, ranking, etc.), with no other 
factors considered; or 
ii. 
 to use a simplified output as one of a set of criteria where the simplified output is weighted 
more than any other criterion in the set; or   
iii. 
to use a simplified output to overrule conclusions derived from other factors including 
human decision-making.  
  
Bias Audit. “Bias audit” means “Bias audit” as defined by § 20-870 of the Code.  
 
Candidate for Employment. “Candidate for employment” means a person who has applied for a specific 
employment position by submitting the necessary information or items in the format required by the 
employer or employment agency.  
 
Category. “Category” means any component 1 category required to be reported by employers pursuant 
to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States Code as specified in part 1602.7 of 
title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, as designated on the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission Employer Information Report EEO-1. 
 
Code. “Code” means the Administrative Code of the City of New York. 
 
Distribution Date. “Distribution date” means the date the employer or employment agency began using 
a specific AEDT.  
 
Employment Decision. “Employment decision” means “Employment decision” as defined by § 20-870 
of the Code. 
 
Employment Agency. “Employment agency” means “Employment agency” as defined by 6 RCNY § 5-

These outputs are used to significantly assist or replace human decision-making in employment-related decisions that affect individuals. This term excludes tools that do not automate or support decision-making processes and do not have a material impact on individuals, such as junk email filters, firewalls, antivirus software, calculators, spreadsheets, databases, or other data compilations.",True,"The agent's answer captures the essential elements of the ground truth definition, including the use of computational processes like machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence to produce outputs that assist or replace human decision-making in employment-related decisions. The additional details provided by the agent do not contradict the ground truth and offer further clarification.",1.0,0.9230769230769232,0.9841168699248168,0.99999999995,4.0,"The generated answer accurately defines an automated employment decision tool and covers all components of the query, but it includes unnecessary exclusions that do not align with the reference answer."
What must a bias audit of an AEDT calculate?,"A bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate and impact ratio for each category, including sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race. It must also indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT that fall within an unknown category.","Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;",[],"{'question_type': 'simple', 'seed_document_id': 9, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","The published results of a bias audit must include the following:

New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection 
 
Notice of Adoption of Final Rule 
 
Pursuant to the authority vested in the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection by 
Sections 1043 and 2203(f) of the New York City Charter and Section 20-104(b) of the New York City 
Administrative Code, and in accordance with the requirements of Section 1043 of the New York City Charter, 
the Department amends Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York.  
 
An initial version of this rule was proposed and published on September 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on 
November 4, 2022, and comments regarding the rule were received. DCWP proposed a second version of this 
rule on December 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on January 23, 2023, and comments regarding the rule 
were received.  
 
Statement of Basis and Purpose 
 
The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP” or “Department”) is adding rules to implement 
new legislation regarding automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”). Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits 
employers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has 
been subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly 
available, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   
 
These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.

publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:

calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'simple', 'seed_document_id': 15, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","The calculations required in the bias audit for the impact ratio involve the following steps:

1. **Selection Rate Impact Ratio**:
   - **Calculate the selection rate for each category**: This is the proportion of individuals in a specific category who are selected.
   - **Determine the most selected category**: Identify the category with the highest selection rate.
   - **Compute the impact ratio**: Divide the selection rate of each category by the selection rate of the most selected category.

   \[ \text{Impact Ratio} = \frac{\text{Selection Rate for a Category}}{\text{Selection Rate of the Most Selected Category}} \]

2. **Scoring Rate Impact Ratio**:
   - **Calculate the scoring rate for each category**: This is the average score or proportion of individuals in a specific category who achieve a certain score.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;

for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;",[],"{'question_type': 'simple', 'seed_document_id': 14, 'topic': 'Employment Bias Audit', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","### What is an AEDT?

An AEDT, or Automated Employment Decision Tool, refers to a tool that relies solely on a simplified output such as a score, tag, classification, or ranking, with no other factors considered, to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-making in employment decisions.

### Requirements for a Bias Audit of an AEDT

1. **Scoring Requirements**:
   - Calculate the median score for the full sample of applicants.
   - Calculate the scoring rate for individuals in each category.

2. **Data Requirements**:
   - **Historical Data**: The audit must use historical data from the AEDT. This data can come from one or more employers or employment agencies that use the AEDT. An individual employer or employment agency can rely on a bias audit using historical data from other employers or agencies if they have provided their own historical data to the auditor or if they have never used the AEDT.
   - **Test Data**: If there is insufficient historical data to conduct a statistically significant bias audit, test data may be used. The summary of the bias audit results must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data was generated and obtained.

may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT.

Document 0: Subchapter 25: Automated Employment Decision Tools
§ 20-870 Definitions.
For the purposes of this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings:
   Automated employment decision tool. The term ""automated employment decision tool"" means any computational process, derived from machine
learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence, that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation,
that is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons. The term
""automated employment decision tool"" does not include a tool that does not automate, support, substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-
making processes and that does not materially impact natural persons, including, but not limited to, a junk email filter, firewall, antivirus software,
calculator, spreadsheet, database, data set, or other compilation of data.
   Bias audit. The term ""bias audit"" means an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor. Such bias audit shall include but not be limited to the
testing of an automated employment decision tool to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported
by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of
federal regulations.
   Employment decision. The term ""employment decision"" means to screen candidates for employment or employees for promotion within the city.
(L.L. 2021/144, 12/11/2021, eff. 1/1/2023)
§ 20-871 Requirements for automated employment decision tools.
   a.   In the city, it shall be unlawful for an employer or an employment agency to use an automated employment decision tool to screen a candidate or
employee for an employment decision unless:
      1.   Such tool has been the subject of a bias audit conducted no more than one year prior to the use of such tool; and
      2.   A summary of the results of the most recent bias audit of such tool as well as the distribution date of the tool to which such audit applies has been
made publicly available on the website of the employer or employment agency prior to the use of such tool.

This involves testing the tool to assess its disparate impact on individuals based on specific categories that employers are required to report, as specified in relevant federal regulations. The goal is to ensure fairness and mitigate any unintended biases in the decision-making process.",True,"The agent's answer correctly explains the purpose of a bias audit for automated employment decision tools, including the assessment of disparate impact and the goal of ensuring fairness, which aligns with the ground truth.",1.0,0.75,0.9870845292896502,0.8333333332916666,4.0,"The generated answer correctly addresses the purpose of a bias audit and includes relevant details, but it could be slightly more concise and focused on the core purpose without additional elaboration."
What are the requirements for the published results of the bias audit?,The requirements for the published results of the required bias audit are clarified in the new rules. These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category that is required to be reported to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to determine an impact ratio.,"Document 9: 4 
 
iii. 
at any point during the bias audit, has a direct financial interest or a material indirect 
financial interest in an employer or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to 
use the  AEDT or in a vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT. 
 
Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.  
 
 
 
    _________selection rate for a category________  
Impact Ratio =        selection rate of the most selected category  
 
OR 
 
  
 
     ______scoring rate for a category__________  
Impact Ratio =        scoring rate of the highest scoring category 
 
 
Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 


"What are the specific calculations and requirements for conducting a bias audit of an AEDT, including the categories that need to be considered and the conditions under which historical data or test data can be used?","The minimum requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT are: calculating the selection rate and impact ratio for each category, including sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race; performing these calculations for each group if the AEDT classifies candidates into specified groups; and indicating the number of individuals not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category.","Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and,

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex', 'seed_document_id': 11, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","### Specific Calculations and Requirements for Conducting a Bias Audit of an AEDT

1. **Median Score Calculation**: Calculate the median score for the full sample of applicants.
2. **Scoring Rate Calculation**: Calculate the scoring rate for individuals in each category.
3. **Intersectional Categories**: Perform calculations for intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race.
4. **Group-Specific Calculations**: Ensure that the calculations are performed for each group if the AEDT classifies candidates into specified groups.
5. **Exclusion Reporting**: Indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT who are not included in the required calculations because they fall within an unknown category.

### Categories to be Considered for a Bias Audit of an AEDT

1. **Sex Categories**: For example, male vs. female candidates.
2. **Race/Ethnicity Categories**: For example, Hispanic or Latino candidates vs. Black or African American (Not Hispanic or Latino) candidates.
3. **Intersectional Categories**: For example, Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American female candidates.

### Conditions for Using Historical Data or Test Data

- **Historical Data**: Must be used for a bias audit. An employer or employment agency can rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies if they provide their own historical data to the independent auditor or if they have never used the AEDT.
- **Test Data**: Can be used if insufficient historical data is available to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. In such cases, the summary of results must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data was generated and obtained.",False,"The agent's answer includes additional details and specific calculations that are not mentioned in the ground truth. The ground truth focuses on the minimum requirements, such as calculating the selection rate and impact ratio for each category, performing these calculations for each group, and indicating the number of individuals not included in the calculations. The agent's answer, while detailed, does not align precisely with the ground truth requirements.",1.0,0.7857142857142857,0.9683260135450328,0.9999999999666668,3.0,"The generated answer covers multiple components of the user query correctly but includes some inaccuracies, such as the focus on median score calculation, which is not mentioned in the reference answer."
What is the definition of 'Impact Ratio' and how is it calculated in relation to the selection rate or scoring rate of different categories?,"The 'Impact Ratio' can be calculated either as the selection rate for a category divided by the selection rate of the most selected category, or as the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the highest scoring category.","Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

financial interest in an employer or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to 
use the  AEDT or in a vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT. 
 
Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.

Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification.

What is the difference between historical data and test data in the context of conducting a bias audit for an AEDT?,'Test data' refers to data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.,"Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency

agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection 
 
Notice of Adoption of Final Rule 
 
Pursuant to the authority vested in the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection by 
Sections 1043 and 2203(f) of the New York City Charter and Section 20-104(b) of the New York City 
Administrative Code, and in accordance with the requirements of Section 1043 of the New York City Charter, 
the Department amends Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York.  
 
An initial version of this rule was proposed and published on September 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on 
November 4, 2022, and comments regarding the rule were received. DCWP proposed a second version of this 
rule on December 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on January 23, 2023, and comments regarding the rule 
were received.  
 
Statement of Basis and Purpose 
 
The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP” or “Department”) is adding rules to implement 
new legislation regarding automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”). Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits 
employers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has 
been subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly 
available, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   
 
These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex', 'seed_document_id': 15, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","### Steps and Criteria for Conducting a Bias Audit of an AEDT

1. **Calculate Selection Rates**:
   - Determine the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category as required by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report.

2. **Compare Selection Rates**:
   - Compare the selection rates to the most selected category to determine an impact ratio.

3. **Consistency with EEOC Guidelines**:
   - Ensure these calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures.

4. **Scoring for Employment or Promotion**:
   - For AEDTs that score candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion:
     - Calculate the median score for the full sample of applicants.
     - Calculate the scoring rate for individuals in each category.

### Calculating Impact Ratios

1. **Determine the Scoring Rate for Each Category**:
   - Calculate the scoring rate for each category by dividing the number of applicants who scored positively by the total number of applicants in that category.

2. **Identify the Highest Scoring Rate**:
   - Identify the category with the highest scoring rate, which will serve as the reference category.

3. **Calculate the Impact Ratio**:
   - For each category, divide the scoring rate of that category by the scoring rate of the reference category. This will give you the impact ratio for each category.

#### Example Calculations

- **Sex Categories**:
  - If the scoring rate for male candidates is 54.3% and for female candidates is 44.7%, and the highest scoring rate is 54.3% (for males), then the impact ratio for females would be:
    \[
    \text{Impact Ratio for Females} = \frac{44.7\%}{54.3\%} = 0.82
    \]

- **Race/Ethnicity Categories**:
  - If the scoring rate for Hispanic or Latino candidates is 64.2% (the highest), and for White (Not Hispanic or Latino) candidates is 37.5%, then the impact ratio for White candidates would be:
    \[
    \text{Impact Ratio for White Candidates} = \frac{37.5\%}{64.2\%} = 0.58
    \]

- **Intersectional Categories**:
  - The same method applies, where you calculate the scoring rate for each intersectional group and then divide by the highest scoring rate among those groups to get the impact ratio.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed methodology for conducting a bias audit, including steps and example calculations, but it does not mention the requirement to indicate the number of individuals excluded from the calculations due to falling within an unknown category, which is a key part of the ground truth answer.",1.0,0.625,0.9298569227253636,0.99999999995,4.0,"The generated answer provides a comprehensive overview of the steps and criteria for conducting a bias audit of an AEDT, correctly addressing the calculation of impact ratios and selection rates, with only minor omissions regarding the indication of individuals excluded from calculations."
What information does an employer or employment agency need to make publicly available before using an AEDT?,"Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency must make publicly available on the employment section of their website the date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results. The summary should include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT that fall within an unknown category, and the number of applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios for all categories.

(a) The notice required by § 20-871(b)(1) of the Code must include instructions for how an individual can 
request an alternative selection process or a reasonable accommodation under other laws, if 
available. Nothing in this subchapter requires an employer or employment agency to provide an 
alternative selection process. 
(b) To comply with § 20-871(b)(1) and (2) of the Code, an employer or employment agency may provide 
notice to a candidate for employment who resides in the city by doing any of the following: 
(1) Provide notice on the employment section of its website in a clear and conspicuous manner

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1)

include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of

The Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT) plays a crucial role in conducting bias audits by performing the following functions:

1. **Scoring Candidates**: The AEDT scores candidates for employment or promotion.
2. **Selection Process**: It selects candidates to move forward in the hiring process.
3. **Classification**: The AEDT classifies candidates into different groups.

During a bias audit, the AEDT must calculate:
- The median score for all applicants.
- The scoring rate for each category.
- The selection rate for each category.
- The impact ratio for each category.

Additionally, the audit must separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on sex and race/ethnicity categories.

### Requirements for Using Historical Data in a Bias Audit

When conducting a bias audit, the following requirements apply to the use of historical data:

1. **Use of Historical Data**: A bias audit must utilize historical data of the AEDT.
2. **Reliance on External Historical Data**: An employer or employment agency can rely on a bias audit using historical data from other employers or employment agencies if:
   - They provide their own historical data to the independent auditor.
   - They have never used the AEDT before.
3. **Insufficient Historical Data**: If there is insufficient historical data available, test data may be used. However, the summary of results must:
   - Explain why historical data was not used.

(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex', 'seed_document_id': 13, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","The role of the Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT) in the bias audit is to ensure that the tool used for scoring, selecting, or classifying candidates for employment or promotion is evaluated for fairness.

Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Document 6: 2 
 
 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.

New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection 
 
Notice of Adoption of Final Rule 
 
Pursuant to the authority vested in the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection by 
Sections 1043 and 2203(f) of the New York City Charter and Section 20-104(b) of the New York City 
Administrative Code, and in accordance with the requirements of Section 1043 of the New York City Charter, 
the Department amends Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York.  
 
An initial version of this rule was proposed and published on September 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on 
November 4, 2022, and comments regarding the rule were received. DCWP proposed a second version of this 
rule on December 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on January 23, 2023, and comments regarding the rule 
were received.  
 
Statement of Basis and Purpose 
 
The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP” or “Department”) is adding rules to implement 
new legislation regarding automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”). Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits 
employers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has 
been subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly 
available, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   
 
These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

Document 7: 3 
 
Section 1.  Chapter 5 of Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York is amended to add Subchapter T to read 
as follows: 
Subchapter T: Automated Employment Decision Tools 
§ 5-300. Definitions. 
As used in this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings: 
 
Automated Employment Decision Tool. “Automated employment decision tool” or “AEDT” means 
“Automated employment decision tool” as defined by § 20-870 of the Code where the phrase “to 
substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making” means: 
i. 
to rely solely on a simplified output (score, tag, classification, ranking, etc.), with no other 
factors considered; or 
ii. 
 to use a simplified output as one of a set of criteria where the simplified output is weighted 
more than any other criterion in the set; or   
iii. 
to use a simplified output to overrule conclusions derived from other factors including 
human decision-making.  
  
Bias Audit. “Bias audit” means “Bias audit” as defined by § 20-870 of the Code.  
 
Candidate for Employment. “Candidate for employment” means a person who has applied for a specific 
employment position by submitting the necessary information or items in the format required by the 
employer or employment agency.  
 
Category. “Category” means any component 1 category required to be reported by employers pursuant 
to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States Code as specified in part 1602.7 of 
title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, as designated on the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission Employer Information Report EEO-1. 
 
Code. “Code” means the Administrative Code of the City of New York. 
 
Distribution Date. “Distribution date” means the date the employer or employment agency began using 
a specific AEDT.  
 
Employment Decision. “Employment decision” means “Employment decision” as defined by § 20-870 
of the Code. 
 
Employment Agency. “Employment agency” means “Employment agency” as defined by 6 RCNY § 5-
249.  
 
Historical data.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex', 'seed_document_id': 4, 'topic': 'Automated Employment Decision Tools', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","In the context of automated employment decision tools, a ""bias audit"" is an impartial evaluation conducted by an independent auditor. This audit involves testing the tool to assess its disparate impact on individuals based on various categories that employers are required to report under specific federal regulations.",False,"The agent's answer provides a general explanation of what a bias audit is, but it does not match the specific definition given in the ground truth, which refers to a legal definition under § 20-870 of the Code.",0.0,0.8333333333333334,0.9765767679217806,0.99999999995,4.0,"The generated answer correctly explains the concept of a ""bias audit"" in the context of automated employment decision tools, addressing the query well, but it does not directly reference the specific legal definition provided in the reference answer."
What is the distinction between historical data and test data in the context of conducting a bias audit for an AEDT?,Test data refers to data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.,"Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum:

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex', 'seed_document_id': 18, 'topic': 'Others', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","In the context of conducting a bias audit for an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT), the distinction between historical data and test data is as follows:

1. **Historical Data**:
   - **Definition**: Historical data refers to data collected during the actual use of the AEDT by an employer or employment agency to assess candidates for employment or employees for promotion.
   - **Role in Bias Audit**: Historical data is crucial for conducting a bias audit as it provides real-world evidence of how the AEDT has performed in practice. Employers or agencies can use their own historical data or data from other employers or agencies if they have never used the AEDT themselves. The goal is to ensure the AEDT is not biased based on its historical performance.

2. **Test Data**:
   - **Definition**: Test data is used when there is insufficient historical data available to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. It is generated and obtained specifically for the purpose of the audit.
   - **Role in Bias Audit**: Test data allows for the performance of a bias audit even when there is a lack of sufficient historical data. When using test data, the audit summary must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data was generated and obtained. This ensures transparency and provides a basis for evaluating the AEDT's potential biases.

In summary, historical data is preferred for bias audits as it reflects actual usage, while test data serves as an alternative when historical data is insufficient.",True,The agent's answer provides a detailed explanation of the distinction between historical data and test data in the context of conducting a bias audit for an AEDT. It aligns with the ground truth by explaining that test data is used when historical data is insufficient and is not historical data itself.,1.0,0.6086956521739131,1.0000000000000009,0.9999999999666668,5.0,"The generated answer accurately distinguishes between historical data and test data in the context of a bias audit for an AEDT, covering all components of the query with correct definitions and roles, and providing additional relevant information."
Under what condition can an independent auditor exclude a category from the required calculations for impact ratio?,An independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio.,"Document 16: (d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of

category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

What are the criteria and calculations required for conducting a bias audit on the published results of an AEDT?,The published results of a bias audit must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category required to be reported to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to determine an impact ratio.,"Document 9: 4 
 
iii. 
at any point during the bias audit, has a direct financial interest or a material indirect 
financial interest in an employer or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to 
use the  AEDT or in a vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT. 
 
Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.  
 
 
 
    _________selection rate for a category________  
Impact Ratio =        selection rate of the most selected category  
 
OR 
 
  
 
     ______scoring rate for a category__________  
Impact Ratio =        scoring rate of the highest scoring category 
 
 
Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;",[],"{'question_type': 'complex', 'seed_document_id': 9, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","### Criteria for Conducting a Bias Audit on AEDT Results

i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT;

An AEDT refers to an **Automated Employment Decision Tool**. These tools are used in the hiring process to make decisions about employment, such as screening resumes, conducting interviews, or making hiring recommendations.

### Process for Calculating the Impact Ratio in a Bias Audit of an AEDT

1. **Determine the Selection Rate for Each Category**:
   - The selection rate is calculated by dividing the number of selected individuals in a category by the total number of applicants in that category.

2. **Identify the Most Selected Category**:
   - This is the category with the highest selection rate.

3. **Calculate the Impact Ratio**:
   - The impact ratio is calculated by dividing the selection rate of each category by the selection rate of the most selected category.

Alternatively, if scoring rates are used instead of selection rates, the process is similar:

1. **Determine the Scoring Rate for Each Category**:
   - The scoring rate is calculated for each category.

2. **Identify the Highest Scoring Category**:
   - This is the category with the highest scoring rate.

3. **Calculate the Impact Ratio**:
   - The impact ratio is calculated by dividing the scoring rate of each category by the scoring rate of the highest scoring category.",True,"The agent's answer correctly outlines the process for calculating the impact ratio in a bias audit of an AEDT. It includes determining the selection rate for each category, identifying the most selected category, and calculating the impact ratio by comparing each category's selection rate to the most selected category.

Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.

For the purposes of this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings:
   Automated employment decision tool. The term ""automated employment decision tool"" means any computational process, derived from machine
learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence, that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation,
that is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons. The term
""automated employment decision tool"" does not include a tool that does not automate, support, substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-
making processes and that does not materially impact natural persons, including, but not limited to, a junk email filter, firewall, antivirus software,
calculator, spreadsheet, database, data set, or other compilation of data.
   Bias audit. The term ""bias audit"" means an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor. Such bias audit shall include but not be limited to the
testing of an automated employment decision tool to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported
by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of
federal regulations.

What criteria must be met in order to exclude a category from the required calculations for the impact ratio in a bias audit of an AEDT?,"A bias audit of an AEDT must, at a minimum, calculate the selection rate for each category, calculate the impact ratio for each category, ensure that the calculations separately calculate the impact on sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories, and indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT that are not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category.","Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies;

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.

What calculations are required for a bias audit of an AEDT according to the new rules?,"A bias audit of an AEDT must, at a minimum, calculate the selection rate for each category, calculate the impact ratio for each category, separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories, and indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT that are not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category.","Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.

comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies;

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.

Document 0: Subchapter 25: Automated Employment Decision Tools
§ 20-870 Definitions.
For the purposes of this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings:
   Automated employment decision tool. The term ""automated employment decision tool"" means any computational process, derived from machine
learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence, that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation,
that is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons. The term
""automated employment decision tool"" does not include a tool that does not automate, support, substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-
making processes and that does not materially impact natural persons, including, but not limited to, a junk email filter, firewall, antivirus software,
calculator, spreadsheet, database, data set, or other compilation of data.
   Bias audit. The term ""bias audit"" means an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor. Such bias audit shall include but not be limited to the
testing of an automated employment decision tool to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported
by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of
federal regulations.
   Employment decision. The term ""employment decision"" means to screen candidates for employment or employees for promotion within the city.
(L.L. 2021/144, 12/11/2021, eff. 1/1/2023)
§ 20-871 Requirements for automated employment decision tools.
   a.   In the city, it shall be unlawful for an employer or an employment agency to use an automated employment decision tool to screen a candidate or
employee for an employment decision unless:
      1.   Such tool has been the subject of a bias audit conducted no more than one year prior to the use of such tool; and
      2.   A summary of the results of the most recent bias audit of such tool as well as the distribution date of the tool to which such audit applies has been
made publicly available on the website of the employer or employment agency prior to the use of such tool.

1. **Fairness and Equity**: It ensures that the tools do not disproportionately disadvantage individuals from any component 1 category (such as race, gender, ethnicity, etc.) that employers are required to report. This promotes fairness and equity in employment decisions.

2. **Legal Compliance**: Employers are often required by law to ensure that their hiring practices do not discriminate against protected classes. A bias audit helps in identifying and mitigating any potential biases, thereby aiding in legal compliance.

3. **Transparency and Trust**: An independent audit provides transparency in the hiring process, which can build trust among employees and applicants. It shows a commitment to fair practices and can enhance the employer's reputation.

4. **Improved Decision-Making**: Identifying and addressing biases can lead to better decision-making by ensuring that the most qualified candidates are selected based on merit rather than biased criteria.

5. **Diversity and Inclusion**: By ensuring that automated tools are free from bias, employers can foster a more diverse and inclusive workplace, which has been shown to have numerous benefits, including increased creativity, better problem-solving, and improved financial performance.

Overall, a bias audit is a proactive step towards creating a more equitable and effective employment process.",True,"The agent's answer provides a detailed explanation of why conducting a bias audit is important, covering aspects such as fairness, legal compliance, transparency, improved decision-making, and diversity. While it is more detailed than the ground truth, it aligns with the core purpose of assessing the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category.",1.0,0.2105263157894736,0.9587639885763816,0.8333333332916666,4.0,"The generated answer addresses the importance of conducting a bias audit for automated employment decision tools and covers multiple relevant aspects, but it includes some extraneous information that, while correct, is not directly related to the core query."
What are the requirements for conducting a bias audit of an AEDT used to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job posting?,"The requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT include calculating the selection rate for each category, calculating the impact ratio for each category, separately calculating the impact of the AEDT on sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race, performing the calculations for each group if the AEDT classifies candidates into specified groups, and indicating the number of individuals not included in the calculations due to falling within an unknown category.","Document 14: Data 
on those individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
(c) Where an AEDT scores candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion, a bias 
audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the median score for the full sample of applicants;  
(2) Calculate the scoring rate for individuals in each category;

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;",[],"{'question_type': 'distracting element', 'seed_document_id': 14, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': 'Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job \nposting.

iii. 
at any point during the bias audit, has a direct financial interest or a material indirect 
financial interest in an employer or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to 
use the  AEDT or in a vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT. 
 
Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.  
 
 
 
    _________selection rate for a category________

OR 
 
  
 
     ______scoring rate for a category__________  
Impact Ratio =        scoring rate of the highest scoring category 
 
 
Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;",[],"{'question_type': 'distracting element', 'seed_document_id': 9, 'topic': 'Others', 'distracting_context': '9 \n \nExample 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months.

Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.  
 
 
 
    _________selection rate for a category________

     ______scoring rate for a category__________  
Impact Ratio =        scoring rate of the highest scoring category 
 
 
Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

### Best Practices for Calculating Impact Ratios in a Bias Audit for an AEDT:

1. **Identify Categories**: Determine the categories for which the impact ratios will be calculated, such as sex, ethnicity, and race.

2. **Selection and Scoring Rates**: Calculate the selection rate or scoring rate for each category. The selection rate is the number of individuals selected divided by the total number of applicants in that category. The scoring rate is the average score for individuals in that category.

3. **Comparison**: Compare the selection or scoring rate of each category to the most selected or highest scoring category. This involves dividing the selection or scoring rate of each category by the selection or scoring rate of the most selected or highest scoring category.

4. **Intersectional Analysis**: Perform calculations for intersectional categories, such as combinations of sex, ethnicity, and race, to ensure a comprehensive analysis.

5. **Group Classification**: Ensure calculations are performed for each group if the AEDT classifies candidates into specified groups, such as leadership styles.

6. **Unknown Categories**: Indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT who are not included in the required calculations because they fall within an unknown category.

7. **Regular Audits**: Conduct bias audits regularly, at least annually, to ensure the AEDT remains fair and unbiased over time.

i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

"I'm considering using an AEDT for the first time. Can I rely on a bias audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or can I conduct a bias audit using test data? What is the definition of 'test data' in the context of a bias audit?",'Test data' refers to data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.,"Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category.

Yes, you can rely on a bias audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies for AEDT under certain conditions. If you are an employer or employment agency that has never used the AEDT, or if you provide historical data from your own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit, you may rely on such an audit.

(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection 
 
Notice of Adoption of Final Rule 
 
Pursuant to the authority vested in the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection by 
Sections 1043 and 2203(f) of the New York City Charter and Section 20-104(b) of the New York City 
Administrative Code, and in accordance with the requirements of Section 1043 of the New York City Charter, 
the Department amends Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York.  
 
An initial version of this rule was proposed and published on September 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on 
November 4, 2022, and comments regarding the rule were received. DCWP proposed a second version of this 
rule on December 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on January 23, 2023, and comments regarding the rule 
were received.  
 
Statement of Basis and Purpose 
 
The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP” or “Department”) is adding rules to implement 
new legislation regarding automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”). Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits 
employers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has 
been subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly 
available, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   
 
These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

Can you explain the meaning of test data in the context of a bias audit according to Local Law 144 and other policy documents?,Test data refers to data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.,"Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT.

The summary of the bias audit results must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data was generated and obtained.

"I am an employer using an AEDT to score applicants for 'culture fit' and want to ensure a bias audit was conducted before using the AEDT. What is the threshold for excluding a category, such as sex or race/ethnicity, from the required calculations for impact ratio?",An independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio.,"Document 16: (d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT. 
The employer provides historical data on “culture fit” score of applicants for each category to an 
independent auditor to conduct a bias audit as follows:

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.

"As a lawyer reviewing the requirements for bias audits in accordance with Local Law 144, can you explain what 'test data' means in the context of a bias audit?","In the context of a bias audit, 'test data' refers to data used to conduct the audit that is not historical data.","Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'situational', 'seed_document_id': 18, 'topic': 'Others', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': '{""description"": ""A legal chatbot that provides assistance with Local Law 144 and other policy documents.""}\n<situation>A lawyer is reviewing the requirements for bias audits in accordance with Local Law 144.</situation>', 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","In the context of a bias audit according to Local Law 144, 'test data' refers to data that is used to conduct the audit when there is insufficient historical data available to perform a statistically significant analysis. This test data is not derived from historical records but is instead used to simulate or model scenarios to assess potential biases.",True,"The agent's answer correctly explains that 'test data' is used when there is insufficient historical data and is used to simulate or model scenarios to assess potential biases, which aligns with the ground truth definition.",1.0,0.75,0.951371444158108,0.99999999995,4.0,"The generated answer correctly explains 'test data' in the context of a bias audit and addresses the user query, but it adds unnecessary detail about simulating scenarios that is not explicitly required."
What are the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT according to Local Law 144 and other policy documents?,"A bias audit of an AEDT must, at a minimum, calculate the selection rate for each category, calculate the impact ratio for each category, ensure that the impact calculations are done separately for sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories, and indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT that are not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category.","Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Document 6: 2 
 
 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required

The purpose of the Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT) in the bias audit is to ensure that the tool used for scoring candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion is evaluated for fairness.

"As a student from Canada who will be studying in Europe, what can an independent auditor exclude from the required calculations for impact ratio?",An independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio.,"Document 16: (d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 


"As an employer who has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit, what are the requirements for conducting a bias audit?","To conduct a bias audit, historical data of the AEDT must be used. However, if there is insufficient historical data available, an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data.","Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit. The vendor provides historical data regarding 
applicant selection that the vendor has collected from multiple employers to an independent auditor who 
will conduct a bias audit as follows:

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'situational', 'seed_document_id': 11, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': '{""description"": ""I am an employer who has been using an AEDT for 3 years and I will soon need an updated bias audit."", ""context"": ""Someone recently asked me about an AEDT and how often a bias audit should be conducted.

New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection 
 
Notice of Adoption of Final Rule 
 
Pursuant to the authority vested in the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection by 
Sections 1043 and 2203(f) of the New York City Charter and Section 20-104(b) of the New York City 
Administrative Code, and in accordance with the requirements of Section 1043 of the New York City Charter, 
the Department amends Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York.  
 
An initial version of this rule was proposed and published on September 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on 
November 4, 2022, and comments regarding the rule were received. DCWP proposed a second version of this 
rule on December 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on January 23, 2023, and comments regarding the rule 
were received.  
 
Statement of Basis and Purpose 
 
The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP” or “Department”) is adding rules to implement 
new legislation regarding automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”). Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits 
employers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has 
been subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly 
available, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   
 
These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

Document 0: Subchapter 25: Automated Employment Decision Tools
§ 20-870 Definitions.
For the purposes of this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings:
   Automated employment decision tool. The term ""automated employment decision tool"" means any computational process, derived from machine
learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence, that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation,
that is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons. The term
""automated employment decision tool"" does not include a tool that does not automate, support, substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-
making processes and that does not materially impact natural persons, including, but not limited to, a junk email filter, firewall, antivirus software,
calculator, spreadsheet, database, data set, or other compilation of data.
   Bias audit. The term ""bias audit"" means an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor. Such bias audit shall include but not be limited to the
testing of an automated employment decision tool to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported
by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of
federal regulations.

   a.   Any person that violates any provision of this subchapter or any rule promulgated pursuant to this subchapter is liable for a civil penalty of not more
than $500 for a first violation and each additional violation occurring on the same day as the first violation, and not less than $500 nor more than $1,500
for each subsequent violation.
   b.   Each day on which an automated employment decision tool is used in violation of this section shall give rise to a separate violation of subdivision a

What are the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT and what changes were made in the second version of the proposed rules?,"The requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT include calculating the selection rate and impact ratio for each category. In the second version of the proposed rules, changes were made to the definition of AEDT and the requirements for an independent auditor were clarified.","Document 14: Data 
on those individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
(c) Where an AEDT scores candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion, a bias 
audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the median score for the full sample of applicants;  
(2) Calculate the scoring rate for individuals in each category;

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

1. **Scoring Requirements**:
   - Calculate the median score for the full sample of applicants.
   - Calculate the scoring rate for individuals in each category.

2. **Data Requirements**:
   - **Historical Data**: The audit must use historical data from the AEDT. This data can come from one or more employers or employment agencies that use the AEDT. An individual employer or employment agency can rely on a bias audit using historical data from other employers or agencies if they have provided their own historical data to the auditor or if they have never used the AEDT.
   - **Test Data**: If there is insufficient historical data to conduct a statistically significant bias audit, test data may be used. The summary of the bias audit results must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data was generated and obtained. For example, an employer using an AEDT for the first time may rely on a bias audit using historical data from other employers or test data.

### Changes in the Second Version of the Proposed Rules

- **Definition of AEDT**: Modified to ensure greater focus.
- **Independent Auditor**: Clarified that an “independent auditor” may not be employed by or have a financial interest in an employer or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT, or in a vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT.
- **Required Calculation**: Revised the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates.
- **Impact Ratio**: Clarified that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories.
- **Types of Data**: Clarified the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit.
- **Multiple Employers**: Clarified that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit, provided they supply historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit.
- **Recency of Bias Audit**: Clarified that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old.",True,"The agent's answer provides a detailed and accurate description of the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT and the changes made in the second version of the proposed rules.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.

What are the requirements for a bias audit and what is test data in the context of a bias audit?,The requirements for a bias audit include calculating the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category and comparing the selection rates to determine an impact ratio. Test data in the context of a bias audit refers to data used to conduct the audit that is not historical data.,"Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees

 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.

ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.",[],"{'question_type': 'double', 'seed_document_id': 5, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': [{'question': 'What are the requirements for a bias audit?', 'answer': 'A bias audit must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category and compare the selection rates to determine an impact ratio.'}, {'question': 'What is test data in the context of a bias audit?', 'answer': 'Test data is data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.'}], 'fake_fact': None}","### Requirements for a Bias Audit
1. **Use of Historical Data**: A bias audit must primarily use historical data from the Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT).

   - Explain why historical data was not used.
   - Describe how the test data was generated and obtained.
3. **Scoring Metrics**: When an AEDT scores candidates for employment or promotion, the bias audit must:
   - Calculate the median score for the full sample of applicants.
   - Calculate the scoring rate for individuals in each category.

### Test Data in the Context of a Bias Audit
Test data refers to data used to conduct the bias audit that is not derived from historical data. It is used when historical data is insufficient and must be properly documented in terms of its generation and acquisition.",False,"The agent's answer includes some correct elements but also adds unnecessary details and misses key points.

A bias audit must calculate the selection rate and impact ratio for each category, including sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectional categories.","Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of

An employer or employment agency can provide notice to a candidate for employment by:

1. **Posting on Website**: Posting the notice on the employment section of its website in a clear and conspicuous manner at least 10 business days before using an automated employment decision tool (AEDT).
2. **Including in Job Posting**: Including the notice in a job posting at least 10 business days before using an AEDT.
3. **Direct Communication**: Sending the notice to candidates via U.S. mail or e-mail at least 10 business days before using an AEDT.

### Information to be Made Publicly Available Before Using an AEDT

An employer or employment agency must make the following information publicly available before the use of an AEDT:

1. **Data Retention Policy**: Information on the employment section of its website about its AEDT data retention policy, the type of data collected for the AEDT, and the source of the data in a clear and conspicuous manner.
2. **Request Instructions**: Instructions on the employment section of its website for how to make a written request for such information, and if a written request is received, provide such information within 30 days.

What is the definition of test data and what are the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT?,"Test data means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. A bias audit must calculate the selection rate and impact ratio for each category, including sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories.","Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

### Requirements for a Bias Audit of an AEDT
A bias audit of an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT) must meet the following requirements:

1. **Scoring Requirements**:
   - Calculate the median score for the full sample of applicants.
   - Calculate the scoring rate for individuals in each category.

2. **Data Requirements**:
   - **Historical Data**: The audit must use historical data from the AEDT. This data can come from one or more employers or employment agencies that use the AEDT. An individual employer or employment agency can rely on a bias audit using historical data from other employers or agencies if they have provided their own historical data to the auditor or if they have never used the AEDT.
   - **Test Data**: If there is insufficient historical data to conduct a statistically significant bias audit, test data may be used.

### When an Employer Can Rely on a Bias Audit
An employer can rely on a bias audit in the following situations:

1. **Sufficient Historical Data from Own Use**: If the employer has been using an AEDT and has sufficient historical data from its own use, it can rely on a bias audit conducted using this historical data.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test

An ""Automated Employment Decision Tool"" is defined as any computational process derived from machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence that issues simplified output, such as a score, classification, or recommendation. This output is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons. This term does not include tools that do not automate, support, substantially assist, or replace discretionary decision-making processes and do not materially impact natural persons, such as junk email filters, firewalls, antivirus software, calculators, spreadsheets, databases, data sets, or other compilations of data.

### Bias Audit
A ""Bias audit"" is an impartial evaluation conducted by an independent auditor. This audit includes testing an automated employment decision tool to assess its disparate impact on individuals based on any component category that employers are required to report under specific sections of the United States Code and the Code of Federal Regulations.",True,The agent's answer accurately captures the definitions of both 'Automated Employment Decision Tool' and 'Bias audit' as provided in the ground truth. The slight differences in wording do not change the meaning or the essential details of the definitions.,1.0,1.0,0.9241646375622612,0.9999999999666668,5.0,The generated answer accurately defines both 'Automated Employment Decision Tool' and 'Bias audit' while providing comprehensive and relevant details without any factual errors.
What are the requirements for a bias audit and what is test data?,The requirements for a bias audit include calculating the selection rate and impact ratio for each category. Test data is the data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.,"Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Document 6: 2 
 
 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results. 
 
New material is underlined. 
[Deleted material is in brackets.] 
 
“Shall” and “must” denote mandatory requirements and may be used interchangeably in the rules of this 
department, unless otherwise specified or unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.",[],"{'question_type': 'double', 'seed_document_id': 5, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': [{'question': 'What are the requirements for a bias audit?', 'answer': 'A bias audit must calculate the selection rate for each category and the impact ratio for each category.'}, {'question': 'What is test data?', 'answer': 'Test data is data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.'}], 'fake_fact': None}","### Requirements for a Bias Audit
1. **Use of Historical Data**: A bias audit must primarily use historical data from the Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT).
2. **Use of Test Data**: If historical data is insufficient, test data may be used. The summary of results must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data was generated and obtained.
3. **Scoring Metrics**: When an AEDT scores candidates for employment or promotion, the bias audit must calculate:
   - The median score for the full sample of applicants.
   - The scoring rate for individuals in each category.

### Test Data
Test data refers to data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. It is used when historical data is insufficient and must be properly documented in terms of its generation and acquisition.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed explanation of the requirements for a bias audit and the use of test data, but it does not specifically mention calculating the selection rate and impact ratio for each category, which is a key part of the ground truth answer.",0.5,1.0,0.8957952922587553,0.0,3.0,"The generated answer provides a detailed explanation of the requirements for a bias audit and correctly defines test data, but it includes some inaccuracies regarding the use of historical data and scoring metrics."
What must an employer or employment agency provide in a bias audit and what are the options for providing notice to a candidate for employment?,"An employer or employment agency must provide the date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results. They can provide notice on the employment section of its website, in a job posting, or via U.S. mail or e-mail.","Document 22: 10 
 
(2) Provide notice in a job posting at least 10 business days before use of an AEDT; or, 
(3) Provide notice via U.S. mail or e-mail at least 10 business days before use of an AEDT.  
(d) To comply with § 20-871(b)(3) of the Code, an employer or employment agency must: 
(1) Provide information on the employment section of its website in a clear and conspicuous 
manner about its AEDT data retention policy, the type of data collected for the AEDT, and the 
source of the data; 
(2) Post instructions on the employment section of its website in a clear and conspicuous manner 
for how to make a written request for such information, and if a written request is received, 
provide such information within 30 days; and 
(3) Provide an explanation to a candidate for employment or employee being considered for 
promotion why disclosure of such information would violate local, state, or federal law, or 
interfere with a law enforcement investigation.

Document 21: Nothing in this subchapter requires an employer or employment agency to provide an 
alternative selection process. 
(b) To comply with § 20-871(b)(1) and (2) of the Code, an employer or employment agency may provide 
notice to a candidate for employment who resides in the city by doing any of the following: 
(1) Provide notice on the employment section of its website in a clear and conspicuous manner

1. **Historical Data**: The audit must use historical data from the Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT). This data can come from one or more employers or employment agencies that use the AEDT.
2. **Data Sharing**: An employer or employment agency can rely on a bias audit using historical data from other employers or agencies only if they have provided their own historical data to the auditor or have never used the AEDT.
3. **Test Data**: If insufficient historical data is available, test data can be used. The summary of results must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data was generated and obtained.
4. **Scoring**: For AEDTs that score candidates, the bias audit must calculate the median score for the full sample of applicants and the scoring rate for individuals in each category.

### Purpose of Conducting a Bias Audit

The purpose of conducting a bias audit is to perform an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor to assess an automated employment decision tool's disparate impact on individuals in various categories. This includes testing the tool to ensure it does not unfairly disadvantage any group of people.",False,"The agent's answer provides detailed requirements for conducting a bias audit but does not mention the exclusion of categories representing less than 2% of the data from impact ratio calculations.

'Impact ratio' can either refer to the selection rate for a category divided by the selection rate of the most selected category, or the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the highest scoring category.","Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT.

A bias audit is an impartial evaluation conducted by an independent auditor. It includes testing an automated employment decision tool (AEDT) to assess its disparate impact on individuals based on specific categories required to be reported by employers, as outlined in relevant sections of the United States Code and Code of Federal Regulations.

### Information That Should Be Publicly Available Before Using an AEDT

Before using an AEDT, the following information should be publicly available:

The term ""employment decision"" refers to the process of screening candidates for employment or employees for promotion within a city.

### Requirements for Using an Automated Employment Decision Tool
To use an automated employment decision tool, the following requirements must be met:

1. **Bias Audit**: The tool must have undergone a bias audit within the past year.
2. **Public Availability**: A summary of the most recent bias audit results and the distribution date of the tool must be publicly available on the employer or employment agency's website before using the tool.
3. **Notification**: Employers or employment agencies must notify candidates or employees residing in the city at least ten business days before using the tool. This notification should inform them that the tool will be used and allow them to request an alternative selection process or accommodation.
4. **Disclosure of Assessment Criteria**: The job qualifications and characteristics that the tool will assess must be disclosed to the candidate or employee at least ten business days before use.
5. **Information on Data**: Upon written request, information about the type of data collected, the data source, and the data retention policy must be provided within 30 days, unless such disclosure would violate laws or interfere with law enforcement investigations.",False,"The agent's answer provides a more detailed and expanded explanation of the requirements for using an automated employment decision tool, which goes beyond the ground truth answer.

What are the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT and what is test data?,The requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT are to calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category and compare the selection rates to determine an impact ratio. Test data is data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.,"Document 6: 2 
 
 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results. 
 
New material is underlined. 
[Deleted material is in brackets.] 
 
“Shall” and “must” denote mandatory requirements and may be used interchangeably in the rules of this 
department, unless otherwise specified or unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino

iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.",[],"{'question_type': 'double', 'seed_document_id': 6, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': [{'question': 'What are the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT?', 'answer': 'A bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category and compare the selection rates to determine an impact ratio.'}, {'question': 'What is test data?', 'answer': 'Test data is data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.'}], 'fake_fact': None}","### Requirements for a Bias Audit of an AEDT

1. **Scoring Requirements**:
   - Calculate the median score for the full sample of applicants.
   - Calculate the scoring rate for individuals in each category.

2. **Data Requirements**:
   - **Historical Data**: The audit must use historical data from the AEDT. This data can come from one or more employers or employment agencies that use the AEDT. An individual employer or employment agency can rely on a bias audit using historical data from other employers or agencies if they have provided their own historical data to the auditor or if they have never used the AEDT.
   - **Test Data**: If there is insufficient historical data to conduct a statistically significant bias audit, test data may be used. The summary of the bias audit results must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data was generated and obtained. For example, an employer using an AEDT for the first time may rely on a bias audit using historical data from other employers or test data.

What is the purpose of a bias audit and under what circumstances can an employer rely on it using historical data from other employers?,The purpose of a bias audit is to calculate the impact ratio and selection rate of an AEDT on different categories. An employer can rely on a bias audit using historical data from other employers if they provided their own historical data or if they have never used the AEDT.,"Document 17: 8

these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.

1. Such tool has been the subject of a bias audit conducted no more than one year prior to the use of
such tool; and
2. A summary of the results of the most recent bias audit of such tool as well as the distribution date of
the tool to which such audit applies has been made publicly available on the website of the employer or
employment agency prior to the use of such tool.
b. Notices required. In the city, any employer or employment agency that uses an automated
employment decision tool to screen an employee or a candidate who has applied for a position for an
employment decision shall notify each such employee or candidate who resides in the city of the following:
1. That an automated employment decision tool will be used in connection with the assessment or
evaluation of such employee or candidate that resides in the city. Such notice shall be made no less than ten
business days before such use and allow a candidate to request an alternative selection process or
accommodation;
2. The job qualifications and characteristics that such automated employment decision tool will use in
the assessment of such candidate or employee. Such notice shall be made no less than 10 business days before
such use; and

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.

audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.",[],"{'question_type': 'out of scope', 'seed_document_id': 17, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': 'The AEDT is a software developed by a team of engineers.'}","The information regarding the developer of AEDT software is not available at the moment.

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum:

Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and

a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer

published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Document 6: 2 
 
 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.

ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.",[],"{'question_type': 'out of scope', 'seed_document_id': 5, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': 'The proposed rules received unanimous support from all stakeholders.'}","The proposed rules did not receive unanimous support from all stakeholders.

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT;

§ 20-871 Requirements for automated employment decision tools.
   a.   In the city, it shall be unlawful for an employer or an employment agency to use an automated employment decision tool to screen a candidate or
employee for an employment decision unless:
      1.   Such tool has been the subject of a bias audit conducted no more than one year prior to the use of such tool; and
      2.   A summary of the results of the most recent bias audit of such tool as well as the distribution date of the tool to which such audit applies has been
made publicly available on the website of the employer or employment agency prior to the use of such tool.
   b.   Notices required. In the city, any employer or employment agency that uses an automated employment decision tool to screen an employee or a
candidate who has applied for a position for an employment decision shall notify each such employee or candidate who resides in the city of the
following:
      1.   That an automated employment decision tool will be used in connection with the assessment or evaluation of such employee or candidate that
resides in the city. Such notice shall be made no less than ten business days before such use and allow a candidate to request an alternative selection
process or accommodation;
      2.   The job qualifications and characteristics that such automated employment decision tool will use in the assessment of such candidate or
employee. Such notice shall be made no less than 10 business days before such use; and
      3.   If not disclosed on the employer or employment agency's website, information about the type of data collected for the automated employment
decision tool, the source of such data and the employer or employment agency's data retention policy shall be available upon written request by a
candidate or employee. Such information shall be provided within 30 days of the written request. Information pursuant to this section shall not be
disclosed where such disclosure would violate local, state, or federal law, or interfere with a law enforcement investigation.

 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results. 
 
New material is underlined. 
[Deleted material is in brackets.] 
 
“Shall” and “must” denote mandatory requirements and may be used interchangeably in the rules of this 
department, unless otherwise specified or unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision

candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.",[],"{'question_type': 'out of scope', 'seed_document_id': 6, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': 'One of the comments received was from a technology company.'}","The Department received a variety of comments from stakeholders such as employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency

data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.",[],"{'question_type': 'out of scope', 'seed_document_id': 17, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': 'The scoring rate for Hispanic or Latino females is 90%.'}",The scoring rate for Hispanic or Latino females is 50%.,False,The agent provided a specific percentage (50%) without any context or data to support it.

at any point during the bias audit, has a direct financial interest or a material indirect 
financial interest in an employer or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to 
use the  AEDT or in a vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT. 
 
Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.  
 
 
 
    _________selection rate for a category________  
Impact Ratio =        selection rate of the most selected category  
 
OR 
 
  
 
     ______scoring rate for a category__________  
Impact Ratio =        scoring rate of the highest scoring category 
 
 
Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not

these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'out of scope', 'seed_document_id': 13, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': 'The average age of the male applicants in the White category is 35.'}","The provided information does not include data on the ages of the applicants. Therefore, the average age of the male applicants in the White category cannot be determined from the given data.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 


Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations

Document 0: Subchapter 25: Automated Employment Decision Tools
§ 20-870 Definitions.
For the purposes of this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings:
   Automated employment decision tool. The term ""automated employment decision tool"" means any computational process, derived from machine
learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence, that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation,
that is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons. The term
""automated employment decision tool"" does not include a tool that does not automate, support, substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-
making processes and that does not materially impact natural persons, including, but not limited to, a junk email filter, firewall, antivirus software,
calculator, spreadsheet, database, data set, or other compilation of data.
   Bias audit. The term ""bias audit"" means an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor. Such bias audit shall include but not be limited to the
testing of an automated employment decision tool to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported
by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of
federal regulations.
   Employment decision. The term ""employment decision"" means to screen candidates for employment or employees for promotion within the city.

Proceedings to recover any civil penalties are returnable to a designated tribunal within the office of administrative trials and hearings or any designated city agency.",True,"The agent's answer provides a detailed and accurate definition of an automated employment decision tool and outlines the penalties for violations, which align with the ground truth.",1.0,1.0,0.9412381942964052,0.3333333333,5.0,"The generated answer accurately defines an automated employment decision tool and thoroughly explains the penalties for violations, covering all components of the user query without any errors."
What is the relationship between the definition of 'test data' in a bias audit and the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT?,"In a bias audit, 'test data' refers to the data used for the audit that is not historical data. On the other hand, a bias audit of an AEDT requires calculating the selection rate and impact ratio for each category, including sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectional categories. Therefore, the definition of 'test data' in a bias audit is distinct from the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT, but both are crucial components of ensuring fairness and identifying potential biases in automated systems.","Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or

1. **Definition of 'Test Data'**:
   - Test data in a bias audit refers to data used to conduct the audit that is not historical data.

2. **Requirements for a Bias Audit of an AEDT**:
   - **Scoring Requirements**:
     - Calculate the median score for the full sample of applicants.
     - Calculate the scoring rate for individuals in each category.
   - **Data Requirements**:
     - **Historical Data**: The audit must use historical data from the AEDT. This data can come from one or more employers or employment agencies that use the AEDT. An individual employer or employment agency can rely on a bias audit using historical data from other employers or agencies if they have provided their own historical data to the auditor or if they have never used the AEDT.
     - **Test Data**: If there is insufficient historical data to conduct a statistically significant bias audit, test data may be used. The summary of the bias audit results must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data was generated and obtained. For example, an employer using an AEDT for the first time may rely on a bias audit using historical data from other employers or test data.

In summary, 'test data' is used in a bias audit when there is insufficient historical data to conduct a statistically significant audit. The requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT specify when and how test data can be used, ensuring that the audit remains valid and reliable even in the absence of sufficient historical data.",False,"The agent's answer is overly detailed and includes information not directly related to the question.

### Differences:
1. **Content of Information**:
   - **Publicly Available Information**: Must include details about the AEDT data retention policy, the type of data collected, the source of the data, and instructions for making a written request for such information.
   - **Notice to Candidates**: Must inform candidates about the use of the AEDT, but does not necessarily need to include detailed information about data retention or data sources.

2. **Method of Delivery**:
   - **Publicly Available Information**: Must be posted on the employment section of the website.
   - **Notice to Candidates**: Can be provided through multiple channels, including posting on the website, including in job postings, or sending via U.S. mail or e-mail.

3. **Timing**:
   - **Publicly Available Information**: No specific timing mentioned, but it must be available before the use of the AEDT.

How does the data requirements for a bias audit relate to the process of assessing the impact of an AEDT on different categories?,"A bias audit is a process used to assess the impact of an AEDT on different categories, such as sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectional categories. The data requirements for a bias audit involve using historical data of the AEDT. However, if there is insufficient historical data available, an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data. In both cases, the goal is to evaluate any potential biases and disparities in the AEDT's impact on different categories.","Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'compare', 'seed_document_id': 11, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': [{'question': 'What is a bias audit?', 'answer': 'A bias audit is a process used to assess the impact of an AEDT on different categories, such as sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectional categories.'}, {'question': 'What are the data requirements for a bias audit?', 'answer': 'A bias audit must use historical data of the AEDT, but if insufficient historical data is available, an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data.'}], 'fake_fact': None}","The data requirements for a bias audit and the process of assessing the impact of an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT) on different categories are closely related. Here's how:

### Data Requirements for a Bias Audit:
1. **Historical Data**: The primary requirement is the use of historical data from the AEDT, which can come from one or more employers or employment agencies.
2. **Alternative Data**: If historical data is insufficient for a statistically significant bias audit, test data may be used. The summary of results must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data was generated and obtained.

### Process of Assessing the Impact of an AEDT:
1. **Selection Rate Calculation**: The selection rate for each category (e.g., sex, race/ethnicity) must be calculated.
2. **Impact Ratio Determination**: The impact ratio for each category is then determined. This involves separately assessing the impact on different sex categories (e.g., male vs. female) and race/ethnicity categories (e.g., Hispanic or Latino vs. Black or African American).

### Relationship:
- **Data Utilization**: Both processes rely heavily on the availability and quality of data. Historical data is crucial for both conducting a bias audit and assessing the impact of the AEDT.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The bias audit uses the data to ensure that the AEDT does not disproportionately affect certain demographic groups, while the impact assessment process uses the same or similar data to calculate selection rates and impact ratios for different categories.
- **Transparency and Explanation**: If historical data is not available, both processes require a clear explanation and description of the alternative data used, ensuring transparency in the evaluation of the AEDT's impact.

### Definition:
An **automated employment decision tool** is any computational process derived from machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence that issues simplified outputs (e.g., scores, classifications, or recommendations) to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-making in employment decisions impacting natural persons. This excludes tools that do not automate or materially impact discretionary decision-making processes, such as junk email filters, firewalls, antivirus software, calculators, spreadsheets, databases, or data sets.

### Requirements:
To use such a tool, the following requirements must be met:

1. **Bias Audit**: The tool must have undergone a bias audit within the past year.
2. **Public Disclosure**: A summary of the most recent bias audit results and the distribution date of the tool must be publicly available on the employer or employment agency's website before using the tool.
3. **Notification**: Employers or employment agencies must notify candidates or employees residing in the city at least ten business days before using the tool. This notification should include information about the job qualifications and characteristics the tool will assess.
4. **Data Disclosure**: If not disclosed on the website, information about the data collected, its source, and the data retention policy must be provided within 30 days upon written request, unless such disclosure would violate laws or interfere with law enforcement investigations.

### Relationship:
The definition sets the scope of what constitutes an automated employment decision tool, while the requirements ensure that the use of such tools is transparent, fair, and accountable. The bias audit and public disclosure requirements aim to mitigate potential biases and ensure that the tool's impact on employment decisions is scrutinized and understood. The notification and data disclosure requirements ensure that affected individuals are informed and can understand how the tool influences employment decisions.",True,"The agent's answer correctly explains the definition of an automated employment decision tool and the requirements for using such a tool. It also elaborates on the relationship between the definition and the requirements, aligning with the ground truth that the definition provides a general understanding while the requirements outline legal restrictions and conditions for use.",1.0,0.2916666666666667,0.9999999999999998,0.9999999999666668,4.0,"The generated answer provides a comprehensive definition and detailed requirements for using an automated employment decision tool, accurately addressing the relationship between them, though it could be slightly more concise."
"What is the relationship between test data and the requirements for a bias audit, and how do they differ?","Test data refers to the data used specifically for conducting a bias audit, which is not historical data. On the other hand, the requirements for a bias audit include calculating the selection rate and impact ratio for various categories, such as sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectional categories. While test data is a subset of the data used in a bias audit, the requirements for a bias audit involve specific calculations and analysis of different categories to identify and address biases.","Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'compare', 'seed_document_id': 18, 'topic': 'Others', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': [{'question': 'What is the definition of test data?', 'answer': 'Test data means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.'}, {'question': 'What are the requirements for a bias audit?', 'answer': 'A bias audit must calculate the selection rate and impact ratio for each category, including sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories.'}], 'fake_fact': None}","### Relationship Between Test Data and Requirements for a Bias Audit

Test data can be used in a bias audit when there is insufficient historical data available to conduct a statistically significant audit. In such cases, the summary of the bias audit results must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data was generated and obtained.

### Differences Between Test Data and Requirements for a Bias Audit

- **Test Data**: This refers to data that is specifically generated or obtained for the purpose of conducting a bias audit when historical data is insufficient.
- **Requirements for a Bias Audit**: These typically involve using historical data from the Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT). If historical data is insufficient, test data can be used, but the audit summary must provide a rationale for not using historical data and detail the generation and acquisition of the test data.",False,"The agent's answer does not fully address the requirements for a bias audit, which include calculating the selection rate and impact ratio for various categories. The agent's answer focuses more on the use of test data when historical data is insufficient, but it does not cover the specific calculations and analysis required in a bias audit.",0.6666666666666666,0.8461538461538461,0.9780105698265046,0.3333333333,3.0,"The generated answer partially addresses the relationship and differences between test data and bias audit requirements, but it contains inaccuracies regarding the nature of test data and its role in bias audits."
"What are the differences and similarities between 'selection rate' and 'scoring rate', and how do they relate to each other?","'Selection rate' refers to the rate at which individuals are selected or classified in a hiring process or by an AEDT, while 'scoring rate' pertains to the rate at which individuals receive a score above the sample's median score, calculated by an AEDT. Both rates involve evaluating individuals based on certain criteria, but 'selection rate' focuses on advancement in a process, while 'scoring rate' focuses on achieving a score above a threshold. In some cases, the two rates may be related, such as when a higher 'scoring rate' leads to a higher 'selection rate' for certain categories of individuals.","Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

at any point during the bias audit, has a direct financial interest or a material indirect 
financial interest in an employer or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to 
use the  AEDT or in a vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT. 
 
Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.  
 
 
 
    _________selection rate for a category________  
Impact Ratio =        selection rate of the most selected category

Impact Ratio =        scoring rate of the highest scoring category 
 
 
Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or

**Selection Rate:**
- **Definition:** The rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to move forward in a process (e.g., hiring) or assigned a classification by an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT).
- **Calculation:** 
  \[
  \text{Selection Rate} = \frac{\text{Number of individuals selected or classified}}{\text{Total number of individuals in the category}}
  \]
  For example, if 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview, the selection rate is \( \frac{40}{100} = 40\% \).

**Scoring Rate:**
- **Definition:** The rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above the sample’s median score, where the score is calculated by an AEDT.
- **Calculation:** 
  \[
  \text{Scoring Rate} = \frac{\text{Number of individuals scoring above the median}}{\text{Total number of individuals in the category}}
  \]

### Similarities
1. **Category-Based:** Both rates are calculated for specific categories of individuals (e.g., based on demographics).
2. **Use of AEDT:** Both involve the use of Automated Employment Decision Tools (AEDTs) for their calculations.
3. **Proportional Metrics:** Both are expressed as proportions or percentages.

### Differences
1. **Purpose:**
   - **Selection Rate:** Focuses on the proportion of individuals who move forward in a process or are classified.
   - **Scoring Rate:** Focuses on the proportion of individuals who score above the median score.
2. **Calculation Basis:**
   - **Selection Rate:** Based on the total number of individuals in the category who applied or were considered.
   - **Scoring Rate:** Based on the number of individuals who score above a specific threshold (median score).

### Relationship
- **Interdependence:** While the selection rate and scoring rate are distinct metrics, they can be related. For instance, a high scoring rate in a category might lead to a higher selection rate if the selection process is based on scores.
- **Evaluation:** Both metrics can be used together to evaluate the fairness and effectiveness of AEDTs in different stages of a process (e.g., initial screening vs. final selection).

Understanding both metrics helps in assessing the impact of AEDTs on different demographic groups and ensuring equitable outcomes.",True,"The agent's answer provides detailed definitions, similarities, differences, and relationships between 'selection rate' and 'scoring rate', which align with the ground truth. The additional details enhance understanding without deviating from the core concepts.",0.75,0.7222222222222222,0.8737560201893781,0.9999999999,5.0,"The generated answer accurately defines both 'selection rate' and 'scoring rate', explains their similarities and differences, and discusses their relationship, all while providing correct calculations and examples."
What calculations are required in the bias audit and when can an independent auditor exclude a category from these calculations?,"In the bias audit, calculations include determining the impact ratio for each category and assessing the impact of the AEDT on various demographic categories. An independent auditor can exclude a category from the calculations if it represents less than 2% of the data being used for the audit.","Document 16: (d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

"What is the relationship between the calculations in a bias audit of an AEDT and the requirements for the published results, and how do they differ?","In a bias audit of an AEDT, calculations are performed to determine the selection rates for each race/ethnicity and sex category, which are then compared to calculate an impact ratio. On the other hand, the requirements for the published results of a bias audit involve providing notices to employees and candidates for employment, as well as clarifying other obligations for the employer or employment agency. While the calculations focus on analyzing the impact of bias, the requirements for publishing the results are concerned with ensuring transparency and compliance with legal obligations.","Document 14: Data

(1) Calculate the median score for the full sample of applicants;  
(2) Calculate the scoring rate for individuals in each category;

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;",[],"{'question_type': 'compare', 'seed_document_id': 14, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': [{'question': 'What must be calculated in a bias audit of an AEDT?', 'answer': 'A bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category and compare the selection rates to determine an impact ratio.'}, {'question': 'What are the requirements for the published results of a bias audit?', 'answer': 'The requirements for the published results of a bias audit include providing notices to employees and candidates for employment and clarifying other obligations for the employer or employment agency.'}], 'fake_fact': None}","The relationship between the calculations in a bias audit of an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT) and the requirements for the published results is rooted in ensuring transparency and accountability in the use of AEDTs for employment or promotion decisions. Both aspects aim to provide a clear picture of how the AEDT performs across different groups.

### Relationship:
1. **Calculations in a Bias Audit:**
   - **Median Score:** The audit must calculate the median score for the full sample of applicants.
   - **Scoring Rate:** It must also calculate the scoring rate for individuals in each category.
   - **Group-Specific Calculations:** If the AEDT classifies candidates into specified groups, these calculations must be performed for each group.
   - **Unknown Category:** The audit must indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT who are not included in the required calculations due to falling within an unknown category.

2. **Requirements for Published Results:**
   - **Number of Applicants:** The published results must include the total number of applicants.
   - **Number Selected:** The number of individuals selected must be reported.
   - **Selection Rate:** The selection rate for each category must be provided.
   - **Impact Ratio:** The impact ratio for each sex category must be included.

### Differences:
- **Focus of Calculations:**
  - **Bias Audit:** Focuses on the internal performance metrics of the AEDT, such as median scores and scoring rates, and ensures these are calculated for each group.
  - **Published Results:** Focuses on the outcomes of the selection process, such as the number of applicants, number selected, selection rate, and impact ratio.

- **Detail Level:**
  - **Bias Audit:** Includes detailed calculations for each group and accounts for individuals in unknown categories.
  - **Published Results:** Summarizes the selection process outcomes with specific data points and ratios.

In summary, while the bias audit calculations provide a detailed internal assessment of the AEDT's performance across different groups, the published results present a summary of the selection process outcomes, ensuring transparency and accountability.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed explanation of the calculations and requirements for published results in a bias audit of an AEDT, but it does not accurately capture the key differences as outlined in the ground truth.

To comply with § 20-871(b)(1) and (2) of the Code, an employer or employment agency must provide notice to candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion who reside in the city. The notice can be provided in the following ways:

1. **For Candidates for Employment:**
   - **Website Notice:** Post the notice on the employment section of the employer or employment agency's website in a clear and conspicuous manner at least 10 business days before the use of an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT).
   - **Job Posting Notice:** Include the notice in a job posting at least 10 business days before the use of an AEDT.
   - **Direct Notice:** Send the notice to candidates via U.S. mail or email at least 10 business days before the use of an AEDT.

2. **For Employees Being Considered for Promotion:**
   - **Written Policy or Procedure:** Provide notice in a written policy or procedure that is given to employees at least 10 business days before the use of an AEDT.

### Information to be Made Publicly Available Before the Use of an AEDT

Before using an AEDT, the following information must be made publicly available:

1. **Data Retention Policy and Data Collection:**
   - Information on the employment section of the employer or employment agency's website about its AEDT data retention policy, the type of data collected for the AEDT, and the source of the data.

2. **Instructions for Written Requests:**
   - Instructions on the employment section of the website for how to make a written request for such information. If a written request is received, the information must be provided within 30 days.

3. **Explanation for Non-Disclosure:**
   - An explanation to a candidate for employment or an employee being considered for promotion as to why disclosure of such information would violate local, state, or federal law, or interfere with a law enforcement investigation.

### Comparison

- **Notice Requirements:** Both sets of requirements emphasize the importance of providing notice to candidates and employees. However, § 20-871(b)(1) and (2) focus on the timing and method of providing notice, while the public availability requirements focus on the content of the information to be disclosed.
- **Content of Information:** The public availability requirements are more detailed in terms of the specific information that must be disclosed, such as data retention policies and data sources, whereas § 20-871(b)(1) and (2) are more concerned with ensuring that candidates and employees are informed about the use of AEDTs in a timely manner.
- **Method of Disclosure:** § 20-871(b)(1) and (2) provide multiple methods for delivering notice (website, job posting, direct mail/email), while the public availability requirements specifically mandate that certain information be posted on the employer or employment agency's website and provide instructions for written requests.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed explanation of the requirements for compliance with § 20-871(b)(1) and (2) of the Code and the information that must be made publicly available before the use of an AEDT.

While both concepts involve making assessments, 'Scoring Rate' focuses on evaluating scores based on a median, while 'Screen' involves evaluating candidates for selection or promotion. They are related in the sense that both involve making judgments or decisions based on certain criteria, but they differ in terms of the specific context and method of assessment.","Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above

Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition

(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF

that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and

   - **Definition**: Making a determination about whether a candidate for employment or an employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion process.
   - **Context**: This definition is also specific to employment and promotion processes, not sports.

### Similarities:
- Both terms are used in the context of evaluating individuals, whether for employment or promotion.

Gibson, Brannan, Rivera, Levine, Ayala, Miller, Levin and Barron
A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to automated employment
decision tools
Be it enacted by the Council as follows:
Section 1. Chapter 5 of title 20 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding
a new subchapter 25 to read as follows:
Subchapter 25
Automated Employment Decision Tools
§ 20-870 Definitions. For the purposes of this subchapter, the following terms have the following
meanings:
Automated employment decision tool. The term “automated employment decision tool” means any
computational process, derived from machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial
intelligence, that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation, that is used to
substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for making employment decisions that impact
natural persons. The term “automated employment decision tool” does not include a tool that does not
automate, support, substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-making processes and that does not
materially impact natural persons, including, but not limited to, a junk email filter, firewall, antivirus software,
calculator, spreadsheet, database, data set, or other compilation of data.
Bias audit. The term “bias audit” means an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor. Such bias
audit shall include but not be limited to the testing of an automated employment decision tool to assess the

audit shall include but not be limited to the testing of an automated employment decision tool to assess the
tool’s disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported by employers pursuant
to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of
the code of federal regulations.
Employment decision. The term “employment decision” means to screen candidates for employment or
employees for promotion within the city.
§ 20-871 Requirements for automated employment decision tools. a. In the city, it shall be unlawful for
an employer or an employment agency to use an automated employment decision tool to screen a candidate or
employee for an employment decision unless:
1. Such tool has been the subject of a bias audit conducted no more than one year prior to the use of
such tool; and
2. A summary of the results of the most recent bias audit of such tool as well as the distribution date of
the tool to which such audit applies has been made publicly available on the website of the employer or
employment agency prior to the use of such tool.
b. Notices required. In the city, any employer or employment agency that uses an automated
employment decision tool to screen an employee or a candidate who has applied for a position for an
employment decision shall notify each such employee or candidate who resides in the city of the following:
1. That an automated employment decision tool will be used in connection with the assessment or
evaluation of such employee or candidate that resides in the city. Such notice shall be made no less than ten
business days before such use and allow a candidate to request an alternative selection process or
accommodation;
2. The job qualifications and characteristics that such automated employment decision tool will use in
the assessment of such candidate or employee. Such notice shall be made no less than 10 business days before
such use; and

### Definition of 'Automated Employment Decision Tool' (AEDT):
An AEDT is any computational process derived from machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence that produces simplified outputs (e.g., scores, classifications, or recommendations). These outputs are used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-making in making employment decisions that impact individuals. This definition excludes tools that do not automate or materially impact discretionary decision-making processes, such as junk email filters, firewalls, antivirus software, calculators, spreadsheets, databases, or other data compilations.

### Requirements for Using AEDTs in the City:
1. **Bias Audit**: The AEDT must have undergone a bias audit within the past year.
2. **Public Disclosure**: A summary of the bias audit results and the distribution date of the tool must be publicly available on the employer or employment agency's website before the tool is used.
3. **Notification to Employees/Candidates**:
   - **Usage Notification**: Employees or candidates residing in the city must be notified at least ten business days before the AEDT is used, allowing them to request an alternative selection process or accommodation.
   - **Assessment Information**: Information on the job qualifications and characteristics that the AEDT will assess must be provided at least ten business days before its use.
   - **Data Information**: Upon written request, information about the type of data collected, the data source, and the data retention policy must be provided within 30 days, unless such disclosure would violate laws or interfere with law enforcement investigations.

### Relationship:
The definition of AEDT establishes what constitutes an automated tool that impacts employment decisions. The requirements for using such a tool ensure that its deployment is transparent, fair, and non-discriminatory. The bias audit and public disclosure aim to mitigate potential biases in the tool, while the notification and information requirements ensure that candidates and employees are informed and can seek alternatives if necessary. This regulatory framework is designed to balance the benefits of automation with the need to protect individuals from potential adverse impacts.",True,"The agent's answer is detailed and covers the definition of 'Automated Employment Decision Tool' and the requirements for using such a tool in the city. It explains the relationship between the definition and the requirements, ensuring transparency, fairness, and non-discrimination, which aligns with the ground truth.",0.6666666666666666,0.7727272727272727,0.9722979542441932,0.9999999999666668,5.0,"The generated answer accurately defines 'Automated Employment Decision Tool' and comprehensively outlines the requirements for its use in the city, addressing all components of the user query without any factual errors."
What is the relationship between the definition of 'employment decision' and the requirements for using an automated employment decision tool?,"The term 'employment decision' refers to the screening of candidates for employment or employees for promotion within the city. In relation to this, the requirements for using an automated employment decision tool state that it shall be unlawful to use such a tool unless it has been the subject of a bias audit conducted no more than one year prior to its use.

What is the relationship between the requirements for a bias audit and the concept of test data?,"The requirements for a bias audit involve calculating selection rates for different demographic categories to determine an impact ratio. Test data, on the other hand, refers to the data used in a bias audit that is not historical data. Test data is necessary to conduct a bias audit and apply the requirements. In summary, the requirements for a bias audit rely on analyzing selection rates, while test data is the specific type of data used to perform the audit.","Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Document 6: 2 
 
 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.",[],"{'question_type': 'compare', 'seed_document_id': 5, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': [{'question': 'What are the requirements for a bias audit?', 'answer': 'A bias audit must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category and compare the selection rates to determine an impact ratio.'}, {'question': 'What is test data in the context of a bias audit?', 'answer': 'Test data is data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.'}], 'fake_fact': None}","The relationship between the requirements for a bias audit and the concept of test data is as follows:

1. **Historical Data vs. Test Data**: A bias audit primarily relies on historical data from the Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT). However, if historical data is insufficient for a statistically significant audit, test data can be used as an alternative.

2. **Explanation and Description**: When test data is used, the bias audit must include a summary explaining why historical data was not used. Additionally, it must describe how the test data was generated and obtained.

3. **Calculation Requirements**: For AEDTs that score candidates, the bias audit must calculate the median score for the full sample of applicants and the scoring rate for individuals in each category, regardless of whether historical or test data is used.

In summary, test data serves as a substitute when historical data is lacking, but its use requires thorough documentation and justification in the bias audit.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed explanation of the relationship between historical data and test data in the context of a bias audit, but it does not directly address the core requirement of calculating selection rates for different demographic categories to determine an impact ratio. The ground truth emphasizes the importance of selection rates and impact ratios, which the agent's answer does not explicitly mention.",0.25,0.8,1.0000000000000004,0.8333333332916666,3.0,"The generated answer partially addresses the relationship between bias audit requirements and test data, but it contains inaccuracies regarding the reliance on historical data and lacks clarity on the specific requirements for a bias audit."
What is the relationship between the purpose of a bias audit and when an employer can rely on a bias audit that uses test data?,"The purpose of a bias audit is to calculate the impact ratio for each category and ensure non-discriminatory impact. An employer can rely on a bias audit that uses test data when there is insufficient historical data available to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. In other words, the purpose of the bias audit informs the circumstances in which an employer can use test data for the audit.","Document 17: 8

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.

Section 1.  Chapter 5 of Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York is amended to add Subchapter T to read 
as follows: 
Subchapter T: Automated Employment Decision Tools 
§ 5-300. Definitions. 
As used in this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings:

Bias Audit. “Bias audit” means “Bias audit” as defined by § 20-870 of the Code.  
 
Candidate for Employment. “Candidate for employment” means a person who has applied for a specific 
employment position by submitting the necessary information or items in the format required by the

1. **Notification**: Inform each employee or candidate residing in New York City that an automated employment decision tool will be used in their assessment or evaluation. This notification must be given at least ten business days before the tool is used, allowing the candidate to request an alternative selection process or accommodation.

2. **Disclosure of Job Qualifications and Characteristics**: Inform the employee or candidate of the job qualifications and characteristics that the automated employment decision tool will use in the assessment. This information must also be provided at least ten business days before the tool is used.

An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. Can the employer rely on a bias audit conducted using test data?,"No, the employer cannot rely on a bias audit conducted using test data. According to § 5-303, an employer may rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other employers or employment agencies, but not on a bias audit conducted using test data.","Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'rule_conclusion', 'seed_document_id': 11, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","Yes, an employer can rely on a bias audit conducted using test data for an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT) if there is insufficient historical data to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on

§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'rule_conclusion', 'seed_document_id': 13, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","Yes, an employer can rely on a bias audit that uses test data instead of historical data to assess the impact of their hiring process on different race/ethnicity categories if insufficient historical data is available to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. The summary of results of the bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data was generated and obtained.

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Using Test Data vs. Historical Data

#### Advantages of Using Test Data:
1. **Availability**: Test data can be used when there is insufficient historical data to conduct a statistically significant audit.
2. **Compliance**: Allows employers to perform a bias audit and ensure compliance with regulations even when historical data is lacking.

#### Disadvantages of Using Test Data:
1. **Complexity**: Requires a detailed explanation of why historical data was not used and how the test data was generated and obtained.
2. **Potential Inaccuracy**: May not fully capture real-world scenarios and outcomes, leading to less reliable insights.

#### Advantages of Using Historical Data:
1. **Relevance**: Provides a more accurate and relevant assessment of the hiring process's performance in real-world scenarios.
2. **Reliability**: Reflects actual hiring decisions and outcomes, leading to more reliable insights into potential biases.

#### Disadvantages of Using Historical Data:
1. **Availability**: May not always be available, especially for employers or agencies using the hiring process for the first time.
2. **Applicability**: Limited applicability in situations where historical data is insufficient or non-existent.",False,"The agent's answer is misleading. The correct answer is that an employer cannot rely on a bias audit that uses test data instead of historical data unless there is insufficient historical data available to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.

An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for 'culture fit.' The AEDT conducted a bias audit that excluded a category representing less than 2% of the data used. Is this exclusion allowed under the law?,"No, the exclusion of a category that represents less than 2% of the data used for the bias audit is not allowed under the law. The law requires that all categories be included in the calculations for impact ratio, regardless of their representation in the data.","Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT.

at any point during the bias audit, has a direct financial interest or a material indirect 
financial interest in an employer or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to 
use the  AEDT or in a vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT. 
 
Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.  
 
 
 
    _________selection rate for a category________

OR 
 
  
 
     ______scoring rate for a category__________  
Impact Ratio =        scoring rate of the highest scoring category 
 
 
Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 


Can the employer rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT?,"Yes, the employer can rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other employers or employment agencies.","Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'rule_conclusion', 'seed_document_id': 15, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","To use an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT) to score applicants for 'culture fit,' the employer must ensure the following:

determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

Notice of Adoption of Final Rule 
 
Pursuant to the authority vested in the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection by 
Sections 1043 and 2203(f) of the New York City Charter and Section 20-104(b) of the New York City 
Administrative Code, and in accordance with the requirements of Section 1043 of the New York City Charter, 
the Department amends Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York.  
 
An initial version of this rule was proposed and published on September 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on 
November 4, 2022, and comments regarding the rule were received. DCWP proposed a second version of this 
rule on December 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on January 23, 2023, and comments regarding the rule 
were received.  
 
Statement of Basis and Purpose 
 
The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP” or “Department”) is adding rules to implement 
new legislation regarding automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”). Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits 
employers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has 
been subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly 
available, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   
 
These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.",[],"{'question_type': 'rule_conclusion', 'seed_document_id': 17, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","Yes, an employer needs to conduct a bias audit of an AEDT (Automated Employment Decision Tool) used to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job posting if more than one year has passed since the most recent bias audit.",True,,1.0,0.5,0.9228849787993452,0.99999999995,4.0,"The generated answer is mostly correct and addresses all components of the user query, but it lacks the specific reference to section 5-301 of the Chapter mentioned in the reference answer."

For the purposes of this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings:
   Automated employment decision tool. The term ""automated employment decision tool"" means any computational process, derived from machine
learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence, that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation,
that is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons. The term
""automated employment decision tool"" does not include a tool that does not automate, support, substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-
making processes and that does not materially impact natural persons, including, but not limited to, a junk email filter, firewall, antivirus software,
calculator, spreadsheet, database, data set, or other compilation of data.
   Bias audit. The term ""bias audit"" means an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor. Such bias audit shall include but not be limited to the
testing of an automated employment decision tool to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported
by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of
federal regulations.

§ 20-871 Requirements for automated employment decision tools.
   a.   In the city, it shall be unlawful for an employer or an employment agency to use an automated employment decision tool to screen a candidate or
employee for an employment decision unless:
      1.   Such tool has been the subject of a bias audit conducted no more than one year prior to the use of such tool; and
      2.   A summary of the results of the most recent bias audit of such tool as well as the distribution date of the tool to which such audit applies has been
made publicly available on the website of the employer or employment agency prior to the use of such tool.

What calculations are required?,"The calculations required in the bias audit for the AEDT include: (1) calculating the selection rate for each category, (2) calculating the impact ratio for each category, and (3) ensuring that the calculations separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race.","Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 16: (d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'vague', 'seed_document_id': 15, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","The required calculations are:

1. **Selection Rate Calculation**: Determine the selection rate for each category.
2. **Impact Ratio Calculation**: Calculate the impact ratio for each category.
3. **Separate Assessments**: Ensure separate assessments of the impact of the AEDT (Automated Employment Decision Tool) on:
   - **Sex Categories**: For example, comparing male vs. female candidates.
   - **Race/Ethnicity Categories**: For example, comparing Hispanic or Latino candidates vs. Black or African American candidates.
   - **Intersectional Categories**: For example, comparing Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American female candidates.
4. **Group-Specific Calculations**: Perform these calculations for each group if the AEDT classifies candidates or employees into specified groups.
5. **Unknown Category Indication**: Indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT who are not included in the required calculations because they fall within an unknown category.",True,The agent's answer includes all the required calculations mentioned in the ground truth and provides additional details that are relevant to the context of the question.,0.6666666666666666,1.0,0.8690520866591032,0.99999999995,4.0,"The generated answer correctly addresses all components of the user query with minimal errors, but it includes some additional information that, while accurate, is not strictly necessary for the query."
What should be in the summary?,"The summary of results of a bias audit should include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios for all categories.","Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.

audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.",[],"{'question_type': 'vague', 'seed_document_id': 17, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}",A bias audit is an impartial evaluation conducted by an independent auditor to assess whether an automated employment decision tool has a disparate impact on individuals.

The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio;

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees

The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.

What is the meaning of 'selection rate'?,'Selection rate' means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. It can be calculated by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.,"Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.

What are the required calculations?,"The calculations required in the bias audit for the impact ratio include separately calculating the impact of the AEDT on sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race.","Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'vague', 'seed_document_id': 15, 'topic': 'Employment Bias Audit', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","The required calculations are:

1. **Calculate the impact ratio for each category.**
2. Ensure that the calculations separately determine the impact of the AEDT on:
   - **Sex categories:** Impact ratio for the selection of male candidates vs. female candidates.
   - **Race/Ethnicity categories:** Impact ratio for the selection of Hispanic or Latino candidates vs. Black or African American (Not Hispanic or Latino) candidates.",True,"The agent's answer includes the required calculations for sex and race/ethnicity categories, which aligns with the ground truth.

at any point during the bias audit, has a direct financial interest or a material indirect 
financial interest in an employer or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to 
use the  AEDT or in a vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT. 
 
Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.  
 
 
 
    _________selection rate for a category________  
Impact Ratio =        selection rate of the most selected category  
 
OR 
 
  
 
     ______scoring rate for a category__________  
Impact Ratio =        scoring rate of the highest scoring category 
 
 
Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;",[],"{'question_type': 'vague', 'seed_document_id': 9, 'topic': 'Employment Bias Audit', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","The requirements for the results include:

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.","[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'I would like to know the purpose of conducting a bias audit with the AEDT.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'How can I help you with that?'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'What is its purpose?'}]","{'question_type': 'conversational', 'seed_document_id': 13, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","The purpose of conducting a bias audit with the AEDT (Automated Employment Decision Tool) is to ensure that the tool is not biased in its selection or scoring of candidates for employment or promotion. This involves calculating various metrics such as the selection rate, impact ratio, median score, and scoring rate for different categories, including sex and race/ethnicity, to identify and address any potential biases.",False,"The agent's answer describes the purpose of conducting a bias audit with the AEDT, but it does not directly address the purpose of the AEDT itself, which is to assess historical data and collect data on race/ethnicity and gender categories of applicants and selected individuals.",0.0,0.0,0.7954379040580289,0.0,3.0,"The generated answer partially addresses the purpose of the AEDT but incorrectly defines it as the Automated Employment Decision Tool instead of the Applicant Employment Data Template, leading to some factual inaccuracies."
What is the objective?,"The purpose of a bias audit for an AEDT is to calculate the selection rate and impact ratio for different categories, such as sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectional categories. It also ensures that the calculations are performed for each group if the AEDT classifies candidates into specified groups.","Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Document 6: 2 
 
 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.","[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'I need to know the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'How can I help you with that?'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'What are they?'}]","{'question_type': 'conversational', 'seed_document_id': 5, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","The requirements for a bias audit of an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT) include:

1. **Use of Historical Data**: The audit must utilize historical data from the AEDT. This data can be sourced from one or more employers or employment agencies that have previously used the AEDT. An employer or agency can rely on a bias audit using historical data from other entities if they have provided their own historical data to the auditor or if they have never used the AEDT.

2. **Use of Test Data**: If there is insufficient historical data to conduct a statistically significant bias audit, test data may be used. The summary of results must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data was generated and obtained.

3. **Scoring Candidates**: When scoring candidates for employment or promotion, the bias audit must:
   - Calculate the median score for the full sample of applicants.
   - Calculate the scoring rate for individuals in each category.

These requirements ensure that the bias audit is thorough and based on relevant data, whether historical or test data, to assess the fairness and effectiveness of the AEDT.",False,"The agent's answer does not align with the ground truth.

What is it called?,'Test data' refers to data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.,"Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.","[{'role': 'user', 'content': ""I would like to know the definition of 'test data' in the context of a bias audit.""}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'How can I help you with that?'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'What is it called?'}]","{'question_type': 'conversational', 'seed_document_id': 18, 'topic': 'Others', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","In the context of a bias audit, 'test data' refers to data used to conduct the audit that is not historical data.",True,,0.0,0.0,0.7256225773358904,0.0,5.0,"The generated answer is completely correct, accurately addressing the user query and aligning perfectly with the reference answer."
What are they?,"A bias audit of an AEDT must, at a minimum, calculate the selection rate for each category, calculate the impact ratio for each category, separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories, and indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT that are not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category.","Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Document 6: 2 
 
 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.","[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'I need to know the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'How can I help you with that?'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'What are they?'}]","{'question_type': 'conversational', 'seed_document_id': 5, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","The requirements for a bias audit of an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT) are as follows:

1. **Use of Historical Data**: The audit must utilize historical data from the AEDT. This data can be sourced from one or more employers or employment agencies that have previously used the AEDT. An individual employer or employment agency can rely on a bias audit using historical data from other employers or agencies if they have provided their own historical data to the auditor or if they have never used the AEDT.

2. **Use of Test Data**: If there is insufficient historical data to conduct a statistically significant bias audit, test data may be used. The summary of results must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data was generated and obtained.

3. **Scoring Candidates**: When scoring candidates for employment or promotion, the bias audit must:
   - Calculate the median score for the full sample of applicants.
   - Calculate the scoring rate for individuals in each category.

These requirements ensure that the bias audit is thorough and based on relevant data, whether historical or test data, and that it provides meaningful insights into the AEDT's performance across different categories of individuals.",False,"The agent's answer does not align with the ground truth.

What is the definition?,'Test data' refers to data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.,"Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Specifically, a bias audit calculates several metrics:
1. **Selection Rate**: The rate at which candidates from each category are selected.
2. **Impact Ratio**: The ratio of selection rates between different categories.
3. **Median Score**: The median score for the full sample of applicants.

Document 0: Subchapter 25: Automated Employment Decision Tools
§ 20-870 Definitions.
For the purposes of this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings:
   Automated employment decision tool. The term ""automated employment decision tool"" means any computational process, derived from machine
learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence, that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation,
that is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons. The term
""automated employment decision tool"" does not include a tool that does not automate, support, substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-
making processes and that does not materially impact natural persons, including, but not limited to, a junk email filter, firewall, antivirus software,
calculator, spreadsheet, database, data set, or other compilation of data.
   Bias audit. The term ""bias audit"" means an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor. Such bias audit shall include but not be limited to the
testing of an automated employment decision tool to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported
by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of
federal regulations.
   Employment decision. The term ""employment decision"" means to screen candidates for employment or employees for promotion within the city.
(L.L. 2021/144, 12/11/2021, eff. 1/1/2023)
§ 20-871 Requirements for automated employment decision tools.
   a.   In the city, it shall be unlawful for an employer or an employment agency to use an automated employment decision tool to screen a candidate or
employee for an employment decision unless:
      1.   Such tool has been the subject of a bias audit conducted no more than one year prior to the use of such tool; and
      2.   A summary of the results of the most recent bias audit of such tool as well as the distribution date of the tool to which such audit applies has been
made publicly available on the website of the employer or employment agency prior to the use of such tool.
   b.   Notices required.","[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'I would like to know the purpose of a bias audit for automated employment decision tools.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'How can I help you with that?'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'What is the purpose?'}]","{'question_type': 'conversational', 'seed_document_id': 23, 'topic': 'Automated Employment Decision Tools', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}",The purpose of a bias audit for automated employment decision tools is to conduct an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor. This audit involves testing the tool to assess its disparate impact on individuals based on specific categories that employers are required to report. The goal is to ensure that the tool does not unfairly discriminate against any group.,True,"The agent's answer captures the essence of the ground truth answer, explaining that the purpose of a bias audit is to assess the tool's disparate impact on specific categories of individuals. While the agent's answer is less detailed and does not reference specific legal codes, it correctly conveys the main idea.",0.0,0.0,0.8006695563156316,0.0,4.0,"The generated answer correctly addresses the purpose of a bias audit for automated employment decision tools and covers the main components, but it lacks specific legal references that would enhance its completeness."
What is the meaning of it?,'Test data' refers to data used in a bias audit that is not historical data.,"Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

What are the necessary details?,"A bias audit of an AEDT must, at a minimum, calculate the selection rate for each category, calculate the impact ratio for each category, separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories, and indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT that are not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category.","Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Document 6: 2 
 
 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope;

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.","[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'I need to know the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'How can I help you with that?'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'What are the necessary details?'}]","{'question_type': 'conversational', 'seed_document_id': 5, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","The requirements for a bias audit of an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT) include:

2. **Use of Test Data**: If there is insufficient historical data to conduct a statistically significant bias audit, test data may be used. The summary of results must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data was generated and obtained.

3. **Scoring Candidates**: When scoring candidates for employment or promotion, the bias audit must:

New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection 
 
Notice of Adoption of Final Rule 
 
Pursuant to the authority vested in the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection by 
Sections 1043 and 2203(f) of the New York City Charter and Section 20-104(b) of the New York City 
Administrative Code, and in accordance with the requirements of Section 1043 of the New York City Charter, 
the Department amends Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York.  
 
An initial version of this rule was proposed and published on September 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on 
November 4, 2022, and comments regarding the rule were received. DCWP proposed a second version of this 
rule on December 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on January 23, 2023, and comments regarding the rule 
were received.  
 
Statement of Basis and Purpose 
 
The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP” or “Department”) is adding rules to implement 
new legislation regarding automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”). Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits 
employers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has 
been subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly 
available, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   
 
These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.
