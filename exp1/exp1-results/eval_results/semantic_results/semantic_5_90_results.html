However, generally, it refers to the frequency at which a player or team scores points or goals in a game or over a period of time. It is often expressed as a ratio or average, such as points per game or goals per minute.\\n\\n**Screen:**\\nIn sports, a \\"screen\\" refers to a tactic used to block or impede an opponent&#x27;s movement, often to create space or an opportunity for a teammate. This can involve positioning oneself in a way that obstructs the opponent&#x27;s path or vision, allowing a teammate to advance or take a shot.\\n\\n### Similarities\\n1. **Strategic Elements:** Both concepts involve strategic elements of gameplay. Scoring rate is a measure of offensive effectiveness, while a screen is a tactical maneuver to facilitate offensive opportunities.\\n2. **Team Play:** Both can be influenced by team dynamics. A high scoring rate often results from good teamwork, and effective screens require coordination between players.\\n\\n### Differences\\n1. **Nature:** Scoring rate is a statistical measure, while a screen is a specific tactical action.\\n2. **Application:** Scoring rate applies to the overall performance over time, whereas a screen is a momentary action within a game.\\n\\n### Relationship\\nA screen can directly impact the scoring rate by creating better scoring opportunities for the team. Effective screens can lead to more open shots or plays, thereby potentially increasing the scoring rate.","The relationship between the definition of an &#x27;Automated Employment Decision Tool&#x27; (AEDT) and the requirements for using such a tool in the city is as follows:\\n\\n### Definition of AEDT:\\nAn \\"automated employment decision tool\\" is any computational process derived from machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence that produces simplified outputs (e.g., scores, classifications, or recommendations). These outputs are used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-making in making employment decisions that impact individuals. This definition excludes tools that do not automate, support, or substantially assist in decision-making processes and do not materially impact individuals, such as junk email filters, firewalls, antivirus software, calculators, spreadsheets, databases, data sets, or other compilations of data.\\n\\n### Requirements for Using AEDT:\\n1. **Bias Audit**: The AEDT must have undergone a bias audit within the past year.\\n2. **Public Disclosure**: A summary of the most recent bias audit results and the distribution date of the tool must be publicly available on the employer or employment agency&#x27;s website before the tool is used.\\n3. **Notification**: Employers or employment agencies must notify candidates or employees residing in the city about the use of such a tool at least ten business days in advance. This notice must include:\\n   - Information that the tool will be used for assessment or evaluation.\\n   - The job qualifications and characteristics the tool will assess.\\n   - If not disclosed on the website, information about the data collected, its source, and the data retention policy must be provided upon written request within 30 days, unless disclosure would violate laws or interfere with law enforcement investigations.\\n\\n### Relationship:\\nThe definition of AEDT sets the scope of what tools are considered under this regulation, focusing on those that significantly impact employment decisions through automated processes. The requirements for using AEDT ensure transparency, accountability, and fairness in the use of such tools by mandating bias audits, public disclosure of audit results, and advance notification to affected individuals. This relationship ensures that the use of AEDTs is regulated to prevent discrimination and promote informed consent among job candidates and employees.","The relationship between the definition of &#x27;employment decision&#x27; and the requirements for using an automated employment decision tool is as follows:\\n\\n- **Employment Decision**: This term refers to the process of screening candidates for employment or employees for promotion within a city.\\n\\n- **Requirements for Using an Automated Employment Decision Tool**:\\n  1. **Bias Audit**: The tool must have undergone a bias audit within the past year.\\n  2. **Disparate Impact Assessment**: The audit must evaluate the tool&#x27;s impact on various demographic categories as required by federal regulations.\\n\\nIn essence, any automated tool used to make employment decisions (i.e., screening candidates or promoting employees) must be regularly audited to ensure it does not unfairly discriminate against any demographic group.","The relationship between the requirements for a bias audit and the concept of test data is as follows:\\n\\n1. **Bias Audit Requirements**: A bias audit involves testing an automated employment decision tool to assess its impact on different categories such as sex, the number of applicants, the number selected, the selection rate, and the impact ratio. This typically requires historical data regarding applicant selection to be provided to an independent auditor.\\n\\n2. **Test Data**: When there is insufficient historical data available to conduct a statistically significant bias audit, test data is used. Test data serves as a substitute for historical data in such cases. The summary of the bias audit results must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data was generated and obtained.\\n\\nIn essence, test data is an alternative used in bias audits when historical data is lacking, ensuring that the audit can still be conducted effectively.","The relationship between the purpose of a bias audit and when an employer can rely on a bias audit that uses test data is as follows:\\n\\n- **Purpose of a Bias Audit**: The primary goal of a bias audit is to evaluate the fairness and impartiality of an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT). This involves analyzing historical data regarding applicant selection to identify any potential biases in the selection process based on categories such as sex, ensuring that the tool does not unfairly favor one group over another.\\n\\n- **Reliance on Test Data**: An employer can rely on a bias audit that uses test data when there is insufficient historical data available to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. In such cases, the summary of the bias audit results must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data was generated and obtained.\\n\\nIn essence, the purpose of the bias audit is to ensure fairness in the employment decision process, and when historical data is lacking, test data can be used as a substitute, provided the reasons and methods for using test data are clearly documented.","According to \\u00a7 20-870 of the Code:\\n\\n- An **\\"Automated Employment Decision Tool\\"** is defined as any computational process derived from machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence that provides simplified output, such as a score, classification, or recommendation.

The effective date of the law and the file number and version of the document are unrelated to each other.","Before the use of an AEDT, the employment section of a website must publicly provide the date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results. Additionally, employers or employment agencies have the options to provide notice on the employment section of their website, in a job posting, or via U.S. mail or e-mail. These requirements and options ensure transparency and communication regarding the use of an AEDT in the employment process.","A bias audit is a process used to assess the impact of an AEDT on different categories, such as sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectional categories. The data requirements for a bias audit involve using historical data of the AEDT. However, if there is insufficient historical data available, an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data. In both cases, the goal is to evaluate any potential biases and disparities in the AEDT&#x27;s impact on different categories.","A proceeding to recover a civil penalty authorized by this subchapter can be returnable to any tribunal established within the office of administrative trials and hearings or within any agency of the city designated to conduct such proceedings. The authority to initiate an action or proceeding for correction of any violation lies with the corporation counsel or other persons designated by the corporation counsel on behalf of the department, who may initiate such action or proceeding in any court of competent jurisdiction as deemed appropriate or necessary.","An automated employment decision tool is defined as a computational process that issues simplified output, derived from various technologies. The requirements for using such a tool state that it is unlawful to use it for screening candidates or employees unless it has undergone a bias audit within the past year. Therefore, the definition provides the general understanding of the tool, while the requirements outline the legal restrictions and conditions for its use.","Test data refers to the data used specifically for conducting a bias audit, which is not historical data. On the other hand, the requirements for a bias audit include calculating the selection rate and impact ratio for various categories, such as sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectional categories. While test data is a subset of the data used in a bias audit, the requirements for a bias audit involve specific calculations and analysis of different categories to identify and address biases.","&#x27;Selection rate&#x27; refers to the rate at which individuals are selected or classified in a hiring process or by an AEDT, while &#x27;scoring rate&#x27; pertains to the rate at which individuals receive a score above the sample&#x27;s median score, calculated by an AEDT. Both rates involve evaluating individuals based on certain criteria, but &#x27;selection rate&#x27; focuses on advancement in a process, while &#x27;scoring rate&#x27; focuses on achieving a score above a threshold. In some cases, the two rates may be related, such as when a higher &#x27;scoring rate&#x27; leads to a higher &#x27;selection rate&#x27; for certain categories of individuals.","In the bias audit, calculations include determining the impact ratio for each category and assessing the impact of the AEDT on various demographic categories. An independent auditor can exclude a category from the calculations if it represents less than 2% of the data being used for the audit.","Test data is data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. An employer or employment agency can rely on a bias audit that uses test data if there is insufficient historical data available to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. In other words, test data serves as an alternative when historical data is lacking, allowing employers and employment agencies to still assess and address bias in their processes.","In a bias audit of an AEDT, calculations are performed to determine the selection rates for each race/ethnicity and sex category, which are then compared to calculate an impact ratio. On the other hand, the requirements for the published results of a bias audit involve providing notices to employees and candidates for employment, as well as clarifying other obligations for the employer or employment agency. While the calculations focus on analyzing the impact of bias, the requirements for publishing the results are concerned with ensuring transparency and compliance with legal obligations.","The calculations required for the bias audit include calculating the impact ratio for each category. However, a category that represents less than 2% of the data can be excluded from these calculations. Therefore, the exclusion of categories is a consideration within the calculations for the impact ratio in the bias audit.","An automated employment decision tool refers to a computational process that simplifies decision making in employment by providing scores, classifications, or recommendations. Violating the requirements for such tools can result in civil penalties, with the first violation carrying a maximum penalty of $500, and subsequent violations ranging from $500 to $1,500 per violation.","An automated employment decision tool refers to a computational process that simplifies decision making in employment by providing scores, classifications, or recommendations. However, to use such a tool, there are requirements that must be met. In the city, it is unlawful for an employer or employment agency to use an automated employment decision tool without conducting a bias audit and making the results publicly available. These requirements aim to ensure fairness and transparency in the use of automated tools for employment decisions.","To comply with \\u00a7 20-871(b)(1) and (2) of the Code, an employer or employment agency must provide notice to candidates for employment through various means such as their website, job postings, or mail/email. On the other hand, before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency must make publicly available on their website the date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT, a summary of the results, and the distribution date of the AEDT. While both requirements involve making information available on the employment section of the website, the first focuses on notice to candidates for employment, while the second focuses on information related to the AEDT and bias audit results.","&#x27;Scoring Rate&#x27; refers to the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above the sample\\u2019s median score, calculated by an AEDT. On the other hand, &#x27;Screen&#x27; means making a determination about whether a candidate for employment or employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion process. While both concepts involve making assessments, &#x27;Scoring Rate&#x27; focuses on evaluating scores based on a median, while &#x27;Screen&#x27; involves evaluating candidates for selection or promotion. They are related in the sense that both involve making judgments or decisions based on certain criteria, but they differ in terms of the specific context and method of assessment.","The definition of &#x27;Automated Employment Decision Tool&#x27; refers to a computational process that assists or replaces discretionary decision making in employment decisions. In the city, it is unlawful to use such a tool to screen candidates or employees unless it has undergone a bias audit within the past year. The requirement ensures that the use of these tools is regulated and monitored for fairness and non-discrimination.","The term &#x27;employment decision&#x27; refers to the screening of candidates for employment or employees for promotion within the city. In relation to this, the requirements for using an automated employment decision tool state that it shall be unlawful to use such a tool unless it has been the subject of a bias audit conducted no more than one year prior to its use. Therefore, the definition of &#x27;employment decision&#x27; sets the context for understanding the requirements that must be met when using an automated employment decision tool.","The requirements for a bias audit involve calculating selection rates for different demographic categories to determine an impact ratio. Test data, on the other hand, refers to the data used in a bias audit that is not historical data. Test data is necessary to conduct a bias audit and apply the requirements. In summary, the requirements for a bias audit rely on analyzing selection rates, while test data is the specific type of data used to perform the audit.","The purpose of a bias audit is to calculate the impact ratio for each category and ensure non-discriminatory impact. An employer can rely on a bias audit that uses test data when there is insufficient historical data available to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.

Violating the requirements for such tools can result in civil penalties, with a first violation carrying a maximum penalty of $500 and subsequent violations ranging from $500 to $1,500 per violation on the same day.","An employer or employment agency must provide the date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results on their website. Additionally, they can notify candidates about the use of an AEDT by providing notice on the employment section of their website.","An employer must make the date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results publicly available on the employment section of their website. In contrast, an employer is required to provide notice to candidates for employment via U.S. mail or e-mail at least 10 business days before use of an AEDT. While both requirements aim to ensure transparency and fairness in the use of AEDTs, the information on the website provides ongoing information to the public, while the notice requirement specifically applies to candidates for employment.","In order for an employer in the city of New York to use an automated employment decision tool to screen candidates for a job position, the tool must have been the subject of a bias audit conducted no more than one year prior to its use, and a summary of the results of the most recent bias audit must be made publicly available on the employer&#x27;s website prior to the use of the tool.","No, the employer cannot rely on a bias audit conducted using test data.
