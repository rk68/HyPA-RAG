The summary of results must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data was generated and obtained.\\n3. **Scoring Data**: For AEDTs that score candidates, the audit must calculate the median score for the full sample of applicants and the scoring rate for individuals in each category.\\n\\n### Process of Assessing the Impact of an AEDT:\\n1. **Selection Rate Calculation**: Determine the selection rate for each category.\\n2. **Scoring Rate Calculation**: Determine the scoring rate for each category.\\n3. **Impact Ratio Calculation**: Calculate the impact ratio for each category.\\n4. **Category Assessment**: Assess the impact separately for:\\n   - Sex categories (e.g., male vs. female candidates)\\n   - Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., Hispanic or Latino vs. Black or African American candidates)\\n   - Intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Black or African American female candidates)\\n5. **Exclusion of Small Categories**: Categories representing less than 2% of the data may be excluded from impact ratio calculations, with justification and details provided in the summary of results.\\n\\n### Connection:\\n- **Data Utilization**: Both processes rely heavily on the availability and quality of historical or test data to perform accurate calculations.\\n- **Category Analysis**: Both require detailed analysis of different categories (sex, race/ethnicity, intersectional categories) to ensure a comprehensive assessment of the AEDT&#x27;s impact.\\n- **Transparency and Justification**: Both processes emphasize the need for transparency in the data used and the methods applied, including justifications for any exclusions or use of test data.\\n\\nIn summary, the data requirements for a bias audit provide the foundational information needed to assess the impact of an AEDT on different categories, ensuring that the tool is evaluated fairly and comprehensively.","1. **Where can a proceeding to recover a civil penalty be returnable?**\\n   - A proceeding to recover a civil penalty can be returnable to any tribunal established within the office of administrative trials and hearings or within any agency of the city designated to conduct such proceedings.\\n\\n2. **Who has the authority to initiate an action or proceeding for correction of any violation?**\\n   - The corporation counsel or such other persons designated by the corporation counsel on behalf of the department have the authority to initiate an action or proceeding for correction of any violation.","The relationship between the definition of an automated employment decision tool and the requirements for using such a tool is rooted in ensuring transparency, fairness, and accountability in employment decisions. \\n\\n### Definition:\\nAn **automated employment decision tool** is any computational process derived from machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence that issues simplified outputs (e.g., scores, classifications, or recommendations) to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-making in employment decisions impacting natural persons.\\n\\n### Requirements:\\nTo use such a tool, the following requirements must be met:\\n\\n1. **Bias Audit**: The tool must have undergone a bias audit within the past year.\\n2. **Public Disclosure**: A summary of the most recent bias audit results and the distribution date of the tool must be publicly available on the employer or employment agency&#x27;s website before the tool is used.\\n3. **Notification to Candidates/Employees**:\\n   - **Usage Notification**: Candidates or employees must be notified at least ten business days before the tool is used, allowing them to request an alternative selection process or accommodation.\\n   - **Assessment Information**: Information on the job qualifications and characteristics that the tool will assess must be provided at least ten business days before its use.\\n   - **Data Information**: Upon written request, information about the type of data collected, the source of the data, and the data retention policy must be provided within 30 days, unless such disclosure would violate laws or interfere with law enforcement investigations.\\n\\n### Relationship:\\nThe definition establishes what constitutes an automated employment decision tool, while the requirements ensure that the use of such tools is conducted in a manner that is transparent, fair, and accountable. The requirements aim to mitigate potential biases and provide candidates and employees with sufficient information and recourse, aligning with the ethical use of automated decision-making processes in employment.","### Relationship Between Test Data and Requirements for a Bias Audit\\n\\nTest data is used in a bias audit when there is insufficient historical data available to conduct a statistically significant audit. If a bias audit relies on test data, the summary of results must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data was generated and obtained. This allows an employer or employment agency to still conduct a bias audit even if they lack sufficient historical data.\\n\\n### Differences Between Test Data and Requirements for a Bias Audit\\n\\n- **Test Data**: Refers to data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. It is generated and obtained specifically for the purpose of the audit when historical data is insufficient.\\n  \\n- **Requirements for a Bias Audit**: Typically mandate the use of historical data from one or more employers or employment agencies that have used the Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT). If historical data is insufficient, test data can be used, but the audit must include an explanation for the lack of historical data and details on how the test data was generated and obtained.","### Selection Rate\\n- **Definition**: The rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to move forward in a process (e.g., hiring) or assigned a classification by an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT).\\n- **Calculation**: \\n  \\\\[\\n  \\\\text{Selection Rate} = \\\\frac{\\\\text{Number of individuals selected or classified}}{\\\\text{Total number of individuals in the category}}\\n  \\\\]\\n  For example, if 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40%.\\n\\n### Scoring Rate\\n- **Definition**: The rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above the sample\\u2019s median score, where the score is calculated by an AEDT.\\n- **Calculation**: \\n  \\\\[\\n  \\\\text{Scoring Rate} = \\\\frac{\\\\text{Number of individuals scoring above the median}}{\\\\text{Total number of individuals in the category}}\\n  \\\\]\\n\\n### Similarities\\n- Both metrics are used to evaluate the performance and fairness of AEDTs in processes like hiring or promotions.\\n- Both are expressed as percentages and involve categorizing individuals based on certain criteria (e.g., demographic groups).\\n\\n### Differences\\n- **Focus**: \\n  - Selection Rate focuses on the proportion of individuals who move forward in a process.\\n  - Scoring Rate focuses on the proportion of individuals who score above a certain threshold (the median score).\\n- **Application**: \\n  - Selection Rate is more about the outcome of a decision-making process.\\n  - Scoring Rate is more about the distribution of scores within a category.\\n\\n### Relationship\\n- Both rates can be used together to assess the fairness and effectiveness of AEDTs. For instance, a high selection rate but a low scoring rate might indicate that while many individuals are being selected, they may not be the highest scorers, which could point to potential biases or inefficiencies in the selection process.","### Bias Audit Calculations\\n\\n1. **Selection Rate Calculation**:\\n   - Calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category as required by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).\\n   - Compare these selection rates to the most selected category to determine an impact ratio.\\n\\n2. **Median Score Calculation**:\\n   - Calculate the median score for the full sample of applicants.\\n\\n3. **Scoring Rate Calculation**:\\n   - Calculate the scoring rate for individuals in each category.\\n\\n### Exclusion of Categories\\n\\nAn independent auditor can exclude a category from the bias audit calculations if the category represents less than 2% of the data being used for the bias audit. The summary of results must include:\\n- The independent auditor\\u2019s justification for the exclusion.\\n- The number of applicants in the excluded category.\\n- The scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded category.","The relationship between the definition of test data and when an employer or employment agency can rely on a bias audit that uses test data is as follows:\\n\\n- **Definition of Test Data**: Test data is data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.\\n\\n- **Reliance on Bias Audit Using Test Data**: An employer or employment agency can rely on a bias audit that uses test data if there is insufficient historical data available to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. This situation may arise when an employer is planning to use an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT) for the first time or when an employment agency has been using an AEDT for a short period and does not have sufficient historical data. The summary of results of the bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data was generated and obtained.\\n\\nIn essence, test data is used as a substitute for historical data when the latter is not available or sufficient, allowing the bias audit to proceed under these specific conditions.","The relationship between the calculations in a bias audit of an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT) and the requirements for the published results is that the calculations form the basis for meeting the publication requirements. Specifically, the bias audit must:\\n\\n1. **Calculate the selection rate** for each race/ethnicity and sex category.\\n2. **Compare these rates** to the most selected category to determine an impact ratio.\\n3. **Calculate the median score and scoring rate** for individuals in each category.\\n\\nThese calculations are essential for ensuring that the published results are transparent and accurately reflect the outcomes of the bias audit, thereby meeting the requirements for transparency regarding selection procedures and potential biases.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the requirements for the published results focus on:\\n\\n1. **Clarifying the obligations** for employers and employment agencies.\\n2. **Defining terms** related to the bias audit.\\n3. **Specifying the requirements** for conducting the bias audit.\\n4. **Detailing the notices** that must be provided to employees and candidates for employment.\\n\\nIn summary, while the calculations provide the necessary data to identify and quantify potential biases, the publication requirements ensure that this information is communicated clearly and comprehensively to relevant stakeholders.","The relationship between the calculations required for a bias audit and the exclusion of categories from the impact ratio can be understood as follows:\\n\\n1. **Calculations Required for a Bias Audit**:\\n   - **Selection Rate Calculation**: The selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category must be calculated. This involves determining the proportion of individuals in each category who are selected.\\n   - **Impact Ratio Calculation**: The selection rates are compared to the most selected category to determine the impact ratio. The impact ratio is calculated by dividing the selection rate of one category by the selection rate of a reference category.\\n   - **Median Score Calculation**: The median score for the full sample of applicants must be calculated.\\n   - **Scoring Rate Calculation**: The scoring rate for individuals in each category must be calculated.\\n\\n2. **Impact Ratio**:\\n   - The impact ratio is a measure used to compare the selection rates of different categories to identify potential bias. An impact ratio less than 1.0 indicates potential adverse impact or bias against the category being compared.\\n\\n3. **Exclusion of Categories from the Impact Ratio**:\\n   - Categories that represent less than 2% of the data used for the audit may be excluded from the impact ratio calculation.\\n   - When a category is excluded, the independent auditor must provide a justification for the exclusion, along with the number of applicants and the scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded category.\\n\\nIn summary, the calculations required for a bias audit (selection rates, impact ratios, median scores, and scoring rates) are essential for identifying potential biases. However, categories with insufficient representation (less than 2% of the data) may be excluded from the impact ratio calculation to ensure the reliability and validity of the audit results. The exclusion must be justified and documented by the auditor.","### Requirements for Using an Automated Employment Decision Tool\\n\\n1. **Bias Audit**: The tool must have undergone a bias audit within the past year.\\n2. **Public Disclosure**: A summary of the most recent bias audit results and the distribution date of the tool must be publicly available on the employer or employment agency&#x27;s website before the tool is used.\\n3. **Advance Notification**: Employers or employment agencies must notify candidates or employees at least ten business days in advance that an automated employment decision tool will be used in their assessment or evaluation.\\n4. **Job Qualifications and Characteristics**: The notification must include the job qualifications and characteristics that the tool will use in the assessment.\\n5. **Data Information**: Upon written request, information about the type of data collected, the source of the data, and the data retention policy must be provided within 30 days, unless such disclosure would violate laws or interfere with law enforcement investigations.\\n\\n### Penalties for Violations\\n\\n1. **Civil Penalties**: \\n   - Up to $500 for the first violation and each additional violation occurring on the same day.\\n   - For each subsequent violation, the penalty ranges from $500 to $1,500.\\n   - Each day the tool is used in violation constitutes a separate violation.\\n2. **Failure to Provide Notices**: Failure to provide required notices to candidates or employees also constitutes a separate violation.\\n3. **Legal Proceedings**: Proceedings to recover these civil penalties can be initiated by the corporation counsel or designated persons in any court of competent jurisdiction.","### Relationship Between Automated Employment Decision Tools and Requirements for Using Them\\n\\n**Automated Employment Decision Tools:**\\nAn automated employment decision tool is a computational process that leverages machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence to generate simplified outputs like scores, classifications, or recommendations.
