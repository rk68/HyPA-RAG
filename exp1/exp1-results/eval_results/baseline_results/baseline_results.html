Categories representing less than 2% of the data can be excluded from impact ratio calculations, with justification and details provided in the summary.\\n\\n### Connection:\\n- **Historical and Test Data**: Both the bias audit and the impact assessment rely on historical or test data to perform their calculations.\\n- **Scoring and Selection Rates**: The bias audit requires the calculation of median scores and scoring rates, which are also essential for assessing the impact on different categories.\\n- **Impact Ratios and Category Analysis**: The process of assessing the impact involves calculating impact ratios and analyzing different categories, which aligns with the data requirements for a bias audit to ensure fairness and transparency.\\n\\nIn summary, the data requirements for a bias audit provide the foundational data needed to perform the detailed calculations and assessments required to evaluate the impact of an AEDT on various categories.","1. **Where can a proceeding to recover a civil penalty be returnable?**\\n   - A proceeding to recover a civil penalty can be returnable to any tribunal established within the office of administrative trials and hearings or within any agency of the city designated to conduct such proceedings.\\n\\n2. **Who has the authority to initiate an action or proceeding for correction of any violation?**\\n   - The corporation counsel or such other persons designated by the corporation counsel on behalf of the department have the authority to initiate an action or proceeding for correction of any violation.","The relationship between the definition of an automated employment decision tool and the requirements for using such a tool is rooted in ensuring transparency, fairness, and accountability in employment decisions that impact individuals. \\n\\n### Definition:\\nAn **automated employment decision tool** is any computational process derived from machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence that issues simplified outputs (e.g., scores, classifications, or recommendations) to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-making in employment decisions affecting natural persons. This excludes tools that do not automate or materially impact discretionary decision-making processes, such as junk email filters, firewalls, antivirus software, calculators, spreadsheets, databases, or data sets.\\n\\n### Requirements:\\nTo use an automated employment decision tool, the following requirements must be met:\\n\\n1. **Bias Audit**: The tool must have undergone a bias audit within the past year.\\n2. **Public Disclosure**: A summary of the most recent bias audit results and the distribution date of the tool must be publicly available on the employer or employment agency&#x27;s website before the tool is used.\\n3. **Notification to Candidates/Employees**:\\n   - Candidates or employees must be notified at least ten business days in advance that an automated employment decision tool will be used in their assessment or evaluation. This allows them to request an alternative selection process or accommodation.\\n   - The job qualifications and characteristics that the tool will use in the assessment must be disclosed at least ten business days in advance.\\n   - If not disclosed on the website, information about the type of data collected, the source of the data, and the data retention policy must be provided upon written request within 30 days, unless such disclosure would violate laws or interfere with law enforcement investigations.\\n\\n### Relationship:\\nThe definition sets the scope of what constitutes an automated employment decision tool, while the requirements ensure that the use of such tools is conducted in a manner that is transparent, fair, and accountable. The bias audit and public disclosure requirements aim to mitigate potential biases and ensure that the tool&#x27;s impact on employment decisions is scrutinized and understood. The notification requirements ensure that affected individuals are informed and have the opportunity to seek alternatives or accommodations, thereby promoting fairness and transparency in the employment process.","### Relationship Between Test Data and Requirements for a Bias Audit\\n\\nTest data is used in a bias audit when there is insufficient historical data available to conduct a statistically significant audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data was generated and obtained. This allows an employer or employment agency to still conduct a bias audit even if they lack sufficient historical data.\\n\\n### Differences Between Test Data and Requirements for a Bias Audit\\n\\n- **Test Data**: Refers to data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. It is generated and obtained specifically for the purpose of the audit when historical data is insufficient.\\n  \\n- **Requirements for a Bias Audit**: Typically mandate the use of historical data from the Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT), which can come from one or more employers or employment agencies that have used the AEDT. If historical data is insufficient, test data can be used, but the audit must include an explanation for why historical data was not used and details on how the test data was generated and obtained.","### Definitions\\n\\n**Selection Rate:**\\n- **Definition:** The rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to move forward in a process (e.g., hiring) or assigned a classification by an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT).\\n- **Calculation:** \\n  \\\\[\\n  \\\\text{Selection Rate} = \\\\frac{\\\\text{Number of individuals selected}}{\\\\text{Total number of individuals in the category}}\\n  \\\\]\\n  - **Example:** If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40%.\\n\\n**Scoring Rate:**\\n- **Definition:** The rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above the sample\\u2019s median score, where the score is calculated by an AEDT.\\n- **Calculation:** \\n  \\\\[\\n  \\\\text{Scoring Rate} = \\\\frac{\\\\text{Number of individuals scoring above the median}}{\\\\text{Total number of individuals in the category}}\\n  \\\\]\\n\\n### Similarities\\n1. **Purpose:** Both metrics are used to evaluate the performance and fairness of AEDTs in employment-related decisions.\\n2. **Category-Based:** Both rates are calculated for specific categories of individuals (e.g., based on gender, ethnicity).\\n3. **Numerical Metrics:** Both are expressed as percentages.\\n\\n### Differences\\n1. **Focus:**\\n   - **Selection Rate:** Focuses on the proportion of individuals who move forward in a process or are assigned a classification.\\n   - **Scoring Rate:** Focuses on the proportion of individuals who score above the median score.\\n2. **Calculation Basis:**\\n   - **Selection Rate:** Based on the number of individuals selected out of the total who applied or were considered.\\n   - **Scoring Rate:** Based on the number of individuals scoring above the median out of the total in the category.\\n\\n### Relationship\\n- **Interdependence:** While the selection rate and scoring rate are distinct metrics, they can be related. A high scoring rate in a category might lead to a higher selection rate if the selection process is based on scores.\\n- **Evaluation:** Both metrics can be used together to evaluate the fairness and effectiveness of AEDTs. For instance, if a particular category has a low selection rate but a high scoring rate, it may indicate potential biases in the selection process beyond just the scoring mechanism.","### Bias Audit Calculations\\n\\n1. **Selection Rate Calculation**:\\n   - Calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category as required by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).\\n   - Compare these selection rates to the most selected category to determine an impact ratio.\\n\\n2. **Median Score Calculation**:\\n   - Calculate the median score for the full sample of applicants.\\n\\n3. **Scoring Rate Calculation**:\\n   - Calculate the scoring rate for individuals in each category.\\n\\n### Exclusion of Categories\\n\\nAn independent auditor can exclude a category from the bias audit calculations if the category represents less than 2% of the data being used for the bias audit. The summary of results must include:\\n- The independent auditor\\u2019s justification for the exclusion.\\n- The number of applicants in the excluded category.\\n- The scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded category.","The relationship between the definition of test data and when an employer or employment agency can rely on a bias audit that uses test data is as follows:\\n\\n- **Definition of Test Data**: Test data is data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.\\n\\n- **Reliance on Bias Audit Using Test Data**: An employer or employment agency can rely on a bias audit that uses test data if there is insufficient historical data available to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. The summary of results of the bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data was generated and obtained. Additionally, an employer planning to use an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT) for the first time or an employment agency with insufficient historical data from its use of the AEDT may also rely on a bias audit using test data.\\n\\nIn essence, test data is used as a substitute when historical data is inadequate or unavailable, ensuring that a bias audit can still be conducted under these circumstances.","The relationship between the calculations in a bias audit of an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT) and the requirements for the published results is that the calculations form the basis for meeting the publication requirements. Specifically, the bias audit must:\\n\\n1. **Calculate the Selection Rate**: Determine the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category.\\n2. **Compare Impact Ratios**: Compare these rates to the most selected category to determine an impact ratio.\\n3. **Calculate Median Scores and Scoring Rates**: Determine the median score and scoring rate for individuals in each category.\\n\\nThese calculations are essential for ensuring that the published results are transparent and accurately reflect the outcomes of the bias audit, thereby meeting the requirements for publication.\\n\\n### Differences:\\n- **Calculations in Bias Audit**: Focus on quantitative measures such as selection rates, impact ratios, median scores, and scoring rates for different demographic categories.\\n- **Requirements for Published Results**: Focus on clarifying obligations for employers and employment agencies, defining terms, specifying the requirements for the bias audit, and detailing the notices that must be provided to employees and candidates for employment.\\n\\nIn summary, while the calculations provide the necessary data, the publication requirements ensure that this data is presented transparently and comprehensively to meet regulatory and ethical standards.","The relationship between the calculations required for a bias audit and the exclusion of categories from the impact ratio can be understood as follows:\\n\\n1. **Calculations Required for a Bias Audit**:\\n   - **Selection Rate Calculation**: The audit must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category as required by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).\\n   - **Impact Ratio Calculation**: The selection rates are compared to the most selected category to determine an impact ratio.\\n   - **Median Score Calculation**: The audit must also calculate the median score for the full sample of applicants.\\n   - **Scoring Rate Calculation**: The scoring rate for individuals in each category must be calculated.\\n\\n2. **Impact Ratio**:\\n   - The impact ratio is a measure used to compare the selection rates of different categories (e.g., sex, race, ethnicity) to identify potential bias.\\n   - It is calculated by dividing the selection rate of one category by the selection rate of the most selected category.\\n   - An impact ratio of less than 1.0 indicates potential bias against the category with the lower selection rate.\\n\\n3. **Exclusion of Categories from the Impact Ratio**:\\n   - Certain categories might be excluded from the impact ratio if they represent less than 2% of the data used for the audit.\\n   - When a category is excluded, the independent auditor must provide a justification for the exclusion, along with the number of applicants and the scoring or selection rate for the excluded category.\\n\\nIn summary, the calculations required for a bias audit are essential for determining the impact ratio, which helps identify potential biases in the selection process. However, categories that represent a very small portion of the data (less than 2%) may be excluded from the impact ratio calculation, provided that the auditor justifies the exclusion and reports relevant statistics for the excluded category.","### Requirements for Using an Automated Employment Decision Tool\\n\\n1. **Bias Audit**: The tool must have undergone a bias audit within the past year.\\n2. **Public Disclosure**: A summary of the bias audit results and the distribution date of the tool must be publicly available on the employer or employment agency&#x27;s website before the tool is used.\\n3. **Advance Notification**: Employers or employment agencies must notify candidates or employees at least ten business days in advance that an automated tool will be used in their assessment or evaluation.\\n4. **Job Qualifications and Characteristics**: The notification must include the job qualifications and characteristics that the tool will assess.\\n5. **Data Information**: Upon written request, information about the data collected by the tool, its source, and the data retention policy must be provided within 30 days, unless such disclosure would violate laws or interfere with law enforcement investigations.\\n\\n### Penalties for Non-Compliance\\n\\n1. **First Violation**: A civil penalty of up to $500 for the first violation and each additional violation occurring on the same day.\\n2. **Subsequent Violations**: For each subsequent violation, the penalty ranges from $500 to $1,500.\\n3. **Daily Violations**: Each day the tool is used in violation constitutes a separate violation.\\n4. **Failure to Notify**: Failure to provide required notices to candidates or employees also constitutes a separate violation.\\n5. **Legal Proceedings**: Proceedings to recover these civil penalties can be initiated by the corporation counsel or designated persons in any court of competent jurisdiction.","An **automated employment decision tool** is a computational process that uses machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence to provide outputs like scores, classifications, or recommendations.
