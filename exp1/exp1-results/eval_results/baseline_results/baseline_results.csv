New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection 
 
Notice of Adoption of Final Rule 
 
Pursuant to the authority vested in the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection by 
Sections 1043 and 2203(f) of the New York City Charter and Section 20-104(b) of the New York City 
Administrative Code, and in accordance with the requirements of Section 1043 of the New York City Charter, 
the Department amends Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York.  
 
An initial version of this rule was proposed and published on September 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on 
November 4, 2022, and comments regarding the rule were received. DCWP proposed a second version of this 
rule on December 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on January 23, 2023, and comments regarding the rule 
were received.  
 
Statement of Basis and Purpose 
 
The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP” or “Department”) is adding rules to implement 
new legislation regarding automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”). Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits 
employers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has 
been subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly 
available, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   
 
These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

An automated employment decision tool is defined as any computational process derived from machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence that issues simplified output, such as a score, classification, or recommendation. This output is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons. This definition excludes tools that do not automate, support, substantially assist, or replace discretionary decision-making processes and do not materially impact natural persons, such as junk email filters, firewalls, antivirus software, calculators, spreadsheets, databases, data sets, or other compilations of data.

### Conditions to be Met Before Using an Automated Employment Decision Tool

1. **Bias Audit**: The tool must have undergone a bias audit within the past year.
2. **Public Disclosure**: A summary of the most recent bias audit results and the distribution date of the tool must be publicly available on the employer or employment agency's website.
3. **Notification**: Employers or employment agencies must notify candidates or employees at least ten business days in advance that an automated employment decision tool will be used.
4. **Job Qualifications and Characteristics**: The notification must include the job qualifications and characteristics that the tool will assess.
5. **Data Information**: If not disclosed on the website, information about the type of data collected, the source of the data, and the data retention policy must be provided upon written request within 30 days, unless such disclosure would violate laws or interfere with law enforcement investigations.",False,"The agent's answer includes additional information about the conditions that need to be met before using an automated employment decision tool, which was not part of the ground truth answer. The ground truth only required the definition of an automated employment decision tool.",1.0,1.0,0.9320627853735116,0.8333333332916666,5.0,"The generated answer accurately defines an automated employment decision tool and comprehensively outlines the conditions that need to be met before using it, aligning closely with the reference answer."
"In the context of a bias audit, what is the definition of 'test data' and when can it be used?",'Test data' refers to data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.,"Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

   b.   Notices required.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex_situational', 'seed_document_id': 23, 'topic': 'Others'}","A **bias audit** for automated employment decision tools is an impartial evaluation conducted by an independent auditor. This audit involves testing the automated tool to assess its disparate impact on individuals based on various categories, such as race, gender, or other protected characteristics, as specified in relevant federal regulations.

The purpose of a bias audit is to ensure that these tools do not unfairly discriminate against any group of individuals. In New York City, such audits are required to maintain fairness and prevent discrimination in employment decisions. This helps to ensure that all candidates are evaluated based on their qualifications and merits, rather than being unfairly disadvantaged by biased algorithms.",True,"The agent's answer correctly explains the purpose of a bias audit for automated employment decision tools, including the assessment of disparate impact and the requirement to prevent discrimination. While the agent's answer is more general and less specific than the ground truth, it captures the essential points accurately.",1.0,0.4285714285714285,0.9138179177676372,0.9999999999666668,4.0,"The generated answer correctly explains the purpose of a bias audit and its relevance to preventing discrimination, but it lacks specific reference to the legal framework mentioned in the reference answer."
I'm reviewing a policy document and came across the term 'Impact Ratio.' Can you explain what it means and how it is calculated?,"The 'Impact Ratio' can be calculated as either the selection rate for a category divided by the selection rate of the most selected category, or the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the highest scoring category.","Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.

Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or

New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection 
 
Notice of Adoption of Final Rule 
 
Pursuant to the authority vested in the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection by 
Sections 1043 and 2203(f) of the New York City Charter and Section 20-104(b) of the New York City 
Administrative Code, and in accordance with the requirements of Section 1043 of the New York City Charter, 
the Department amends Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York.  
 
An initial version of this rule was proposed and published on September 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on 
November 4, 2022, and comments regarding the rule were received. DCWP proposed a second version of this 
rule on December 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on January 23, 2023, and comments regarding the rule 
were received.  
 
Statement of Basis and Purpose 
 
The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP” or “Department”) is adding rules to implement 
new legislation regarding automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”). Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits 
employers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has 
been subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly 
available, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   
 
These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

An ""Automated Employment Decision Tool"" is defined as any computational process derived from machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence that issues simplified output, such as a score, classification, or recommendation. This output is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons. This term does not include tools that do not automate, support, substantially assist, or replace discretionary decision-making processes and do not materially impact natural persons, such as junk email filters, firewalls, antivirus software, calculators, spreadsheets, databases, data sets, or other compilations of data.

### Examples of How an 'Automated Employment Decision Tool' Can Be Used

1. **Screening Resumes**: Identifying candidates who meet specific job qualifications.
2. **Assessing Candidates**: Using online tests to evaluate skills and competencies.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex_situational', 'seed_document_id': 6, 'topic': 'Intersectional Categories'}","### Requirements for Conducting a Bias Audit of an AEDT

1. **Calculation of Selection Rates**:
   - Calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category as required by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report.

2. **Comparison of Selection Rates**:
   - Compare the selection rates to the most selected category to determine an impact ratio. This is consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures.

3. **Independent Auditor**:
   - The bias audit must be conducted by an independent auditor who is not employed by or has no financial interest in the employer, employment agency, or the vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT.

4. **Historical Data**:
   - The vendor must provide historical data regarding applicant selection, collected from multiple employers, to the independent auditor for the bias audit.

These requirements ensure that the bias audit is thorough and impartial, helping to identify and mitigate any potential biases in the AEDT.

### Calculation of Impact Ratio

The impact ratio for different categories such as sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectional categories in a bias audit of an AEDT is calculated by comparing the selection rates of different groups. Here’s how it is done:

1. **Identify Selection Rates**:
   - Determine the selection rate for each group within a category (e.g., sex, race/ethnicity).

2. **Determine the Most Favored Group**:
   - Identify the group with the highest selection rate within the category.

3. **Calculate Impact Ratio**:
   - Divide the selection rate of each group by the selection rate of the most favored group within the same category.

#### Example:
- **Sex Category**:
  - If the selection rate for male candidates is 60% and for female candidates is 40%, the impact ratio for female candidates is calculated as:
    \[
    \text{Impact Ratio} = \frac{\text{Selection Rate of Female Candidates}}{\text{Selection Rate of Male Candidates}} = \frac{40\%}{60\%} = 0.67
    \]

- **Race/Ethnicity Category**:
  - If the selection rate for Group A is 70% and for Group B is 50%, the impact ratio for Group B is:
    \[
    \text{Impact Ratio} = \frac{\text{Selection Rate of Group B}}{\text{Selection Rate of Group A}} = \frac{50\%}{70\%} = 0.71
    \]

- **Intersectional Categories**:
  - Apply the same method to intersectional groups (e.g., female Hispanic candidates vs. male Hispanic candidates).

This process helps in identifying any disparities in selection rates among different groups, ensuring fairness and compliance with anti-discrimination laws.",False,"The agent's answer is mostly correct but misses a crucial detail from the ground truth. The ground truth specifies that the audit must indicate the number of individuals not included in the calculations due to falling within an unknown category, which the agent's answer does not mention.",1.0,0.7586206896551724,0.9034534918798416,0.9999999999666668,5.0,"The generated answer thoroughly addresses all components of the user query, providing accurate and detailed information on the requirements for conducting a bias audit of an AEDT and the calculation of impact ratios, aligning closely with the reference answer."
I have been using an AEDT for 6 months and need to conduct a bias audit. Can I rely on my own historical data or do I need to provide data from other employers?,"A bias audit of an AEDT must, at a minimum, calculate the selection rate and impact ratio for each category, separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race, perform the calculations for each group if the AEDT classifies candidates into specified groups, and indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT that are not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category.","Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex_situational', 'seed_document_id': 5, 'topic': 'Intersectional Categories'}","The specific requirements for calculating the impact ratio for different race/ethnicity and sex categories in a bias audit for an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT) are as follows:

### Race/Ethnicity Categories:
1. **Impact Ratio Calculation**: Calculate the impact ratio for each race/ethnicity category.
2. **Separate Assessments**: Ensure separate assessments for various race/ethnicity categories, such as Hispanic or Latino candidates versus Black or African American (Not Hispanic or Latino) candidates.
3. **Intersectional Categories**: Include intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race in the calculations, such as the impact ratio for Hispanic or Latino male candidates versus Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American female candidates.
4. **Unknown Categories**: Indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT who are not included in the required calculations because they fall within an unknown category.
5. **Exclusion Criteria**: Allow an independent auditor to exclude a category that represents less than 2% of the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. The summary of results must include the auditor’s justification for the exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded category.

### Sex Categories:
1. **Separate Calculations**: Separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on sex categories, specifically the impact ratio for the selection of male candidates versus female candidates.
2. **Guideline Compliance**: Ensure that the calculations are done in accordance with the provided guidelines, which include determining the number of applicants, their scoring rates, and the resulting impact ratios for each sex category.
3. **Unknown Categories**: Indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT who are not included in the required calculations because they fall within an unknown category.

It includes calculating the impact ratio for each category, separate assessments for race/ethnicity and sex categories, intersectional categories, and indicating the number of individuals in unknown categories. It also mentions the exclusion criteria for categories representing less than 2% of the data, which aligns with the comprehensive and fair assessment mentioned in the ground truth.",0.6,0.9411764705882352,0.9752746018846116,1.0,4.0,"The generated answer correctly addresses all components of the user query regarding the requirements for calculating the impact ratio for different race/ethnicity and sex categories, with only minor errors in phrasing and organization that do not significantly affect the overall correctness."
I'm reviewing a policy document and came across the term 'Impact Ratio'. Can you explain what it means and how it is calculated?,"The 'Impact Ratio' can be calculated by either dividing the selection rate for a category by the selection rate of the most selected category, or dividing the scoring rate for a category by the scoring rate for the highest scoring category.","Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

1. **Definition**: The impact ratio is a measure used to compare the selection or scoring rates between different categories. It is defined as:
   - The selection rate for a category divided by the selection rate of the most selected category.
   - The scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the highest scoring category.

2. **Calculation**:
   - **Selection Rate Method**: Impact Ratio = (Selection Rate for a Category) / (Selection Rate of the Most Selected Category)
   - **Scoring Rate Method**: Impact Ratio = (Scoring Rate for a Category) / (Scoring Rate of the Highest Scoring Category)

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex_situational', 'seed_document_id': 15, 'topic': 'Intersectional Categories'}","To conduct a bias audit for an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT), here are the requirements and criteria for calculating the impact ratio for sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectional categories, as well as the criteria for excluding certain categories from the calculations:

### Requirements for Calculating the Impact Ratio

#### Sex
1. **Separate Calculations**: Calculate the impact ratio separately for sex categories, specifically comparing the selection of male candidates versus female candidates.
2. **Guideline Compliance**: Ensure calculations are done in accordance with specified guidelines, including indicating the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT who are not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category.
3. **Exclusion Criteria**: An independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of the data being used for the bias audit. The summary of results must include the justification for the exclusion and the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded category.

#### Race/Ethnicity
1. **Separate Calculations**: Calculate the impact ratio for each race/ethnicity category.
2. **Category Assessment**: Ensure calculations separately assess the impact on different race/ethnicity categories, such as Hispanic or Latino, Black or African American (Not Hispanic or Latino), and other specified groups.
3. **Exclusion Criteria**: An independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of the data being used for the bias audit. The summary of results must include the auditor’s justification for the exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and the scoring or selection rate for the excluded category.

#### Intersectional Categories
1. **Separate Calculations**: Calculate the impact ratio for intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race. For example, this involves calculating the impact ratio for the selection of Hispanic or Latino male candidates versus Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American female candidates.

### Criteria for Excluding Categories
1. **Less than 2% Representation**: An independent auditor may exclude a category from the calculations if the category represents less than 2% of the data being used for the bias audit.
2. **Justification and Reporting**: The summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and the scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded category.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

What information does the bias audit summary need to include?,"The bias audit summary needs to include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios for all categories.","Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Section 1.  Chapter 5 of Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York is amended to add Subchapter T to read 
as follows: 
Subchapter T: Automated Employment Decision Tools 
§ 5-300. Definitions. 
As used in this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings: 
 
Automated Employment Decision Tool. “Automated employment decision tool” or “AEDT” means 
“Automated employment decision tool” as defined by § 20-870 of the Code where the phrase “to 
substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making” means: 
i. 
to rely solely on a simplified output (score, tag, classification, ranking, etc.), with no other 
factors considered; or 
ii. 
 to use a simplified output as one of a set of criteria where the simplified output is weighted 
more than any other criterion in the set; or   
iii. 
to use a simplified output to overrule conclusions derived from other factors including 
human decision-making.  
  
Bias Audit. “Bias audit” means “Bias audit” as defined by § 20-870 of the Code.  
 
Candidate for Employment. “Candidate for employment” means a person who has applied for a specific 
employment position by submitting the necessary information or items in the format required by the 
employer or employment agency.  
 
Category. “Category” means any component 1 category required to be reported by employers pursuant 
to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States Code as specified in part 1602.7 of 
title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, as designated on the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission Employer Information Report EEO-1. 
 
Code. “Code” means the Administrative Code of the City of New York. 
 
Distribution Date. “Distribution date” means the date the employer or employment agency began using 
a specific AEDT.  
 
Employment Decision. “Employment decision” means “Employment decision” as defined by § 20-870 
of the Code. 
 
Employment Agency. “Employment agency” means “Employment agency” as defined by 6 RCNY § 5-
249.

These outputs are used to significantly assist or replace human decision-making in employment-related decisions that affect individuals. This definition excludes tools that do not automate or support decision-making processes and do not have a material impact on individuals, such as junk email filters, firewalls, antivirus software, calculators, spreadsheets, databases, or data compilations.",True,"The agent's answer captures the essential elements of the ground truth definition, including the use of computational processes like machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence to produce outputs that assist or replace human decision-making in employment-related decisions. The additional details provided by the agent do not contradict the ground truth and offer further clarification.",1.0,1.0,0.9841416913005384,0.8333333332916666,4.0,"The generated answer accurately defines an automated employment decision tool and covers all components of the query, but it includes unnecessary exclusions that could lead to confusion."
What must a bias audit of an AEDT calculate?,"A bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate and impact ratio for each category, including sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race. It must also indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT that fall within an unknown category.","Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT.

What are the requirements for the published results of a bias audit?,"The requirements for the published results of a bias audit include calculating the impact ratio for each category, separately calculating the impact of the AEDT on sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories, and indicating the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT that are not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category.","Document 9: 4 
 
iii. 
at any point during the bias audit, has a direct financial interest or a material indirect 
financial interest in an employer or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to 
use the  AEDT or in a vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT. 
 
Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.  
 
 
 
    _________selection rate for a category________  
Impact Ratio =        selection rate of the most selected category  
 
OR 
 
  
 
     ______scoring rate for a category__________  
Impact Ratio =        scoring rate of the highest scoring category 
 
 
Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT;

New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection 
 
Notice of Adoption of Final Rule 
 
Pursuant to the authority vested in the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection by 
Sections 1043 and 2203(f) of the New York City Charter and Section 20-104(b) of the New York City 
Administrative Code, and in accordance with the requirements of Section 1043 of the New York City Charter, 
the Department amends Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York.  
 
An initial version of this rule was proposed and published on September 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on 
November 4, 2022, and comments regarding the rule were received. DCWP proposed a second version of this 
rule on December 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on January 23, 2023, and comments regarding the rule 
were received.  
 
Statement of Basis and Purpose 
 
The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP” or “Department”) is adding rules to implement 
new legislation regarding automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”). Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits 
employers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has 
been subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly 
available, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   
 
These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of

calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'simple', 'seed_document_id': 15, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","The bias audit for the impact ratio involves several key calculations:

1. **Impact Ratio Calculation for Each Category**:
   - **Sex Categories**: Calculate the impact ratio for the selection of male candidates versus female candidates.
   - **Race/Ethnicity Categories**: Calculate the impact ratio for the selection of candidates from different racial or ethnic groups (e.g., Hispanic or Latino vs. Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino]).
   - **Intersectional Categories**: Calculate the impact ratio for the selection of candidates based on combined categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American female candidates).

2. **Assessment of Individuals**:
   - Ensure that the calculations separately assess the impact of the Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT) on the specified categories.

3. **Handling Unknown Categories**:
   - Indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT who are not included in the required calculations because they fall within an unknown category.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on:

candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;",[],"{'question_type': 'simple', 'seed_document_id': 14, 'topic': 'Employment Bias Audit', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","### Requirements for a Bias Audit of an AEDT

5. **Notices to Employees and Candidates**: Employers and employment agencies must provide notices to employees and candidates for employment.

### What is an AEDT?

An AEDT, or Automated Employment Decision Tool, refers to a tool that substantially assists or replaces discretionary decision-making in employment processes. This can occur by:

- Relying solely on a simplified output (such as a score, tag, classification, or ranking) without considering other factors.
- Using the simplified output as a heavily weighted criterion among others.
- Using the simplified output to override conclusions derived from other factors, including human decision-making.",False,"The agent's answer provides some relevant information but misses key details from the ground truth.

What is the purpose of the AEDT in conducting a bias audit?,The AEDT is used to assess historical data and conduct a bias audit. It is used to analyze the selection rates and impact ratios of different race/ethnicity and gender categories in order to identify any potential bias in the selection process.,"Document 13: 6

may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT.

Document 0: Subchapter 25: Automated Employment Decision Tools
§ 20-870 Definitions.
For the purposes of this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings:
   Automated employment decision tool. The term ""automated employment decision tool"" means any computational process, derived from machine
learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence, that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation,
that is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons. The term
""automated employment decision tool"" does not include a tool that does not automate, support, substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-
making processes and that does not materially impact natural persons, including, but not limited to, a junk email filter, firewall, antivirus software,
calculator, spreadsheet, database, data set, or other compilation of data.
   Bias audit. The term ""bias audit"" means an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor. Such bias audit shall include but not be limited to the
testing of an automated employment decision tool to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported
by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of
federal regulations.
   Employment decision. The term ""employment decision"" means to screen candidates for employment or employees for promotion within the city.
(L.L. 2021/144, 12/11/2021, eff. 1/1/2023)
§ 20-871 Requirements for automated employment decision tools.
   a.   In the city, it shall be unlawful for an employer or an employment agency to use an automated employment decision tool to screen a candidate or
employee for an employment decision unless:
      1.   Such tool has been the subject of a bias audit conducted no more than one year prior to the use of such tool; and
      2.   A summary of the results of the most recent bias audit of such tool as well as the distribution date of the tool to which such audit applies has been
made publicly available on the website of the employer or employment agency prior to the use of such tool.

Notices required.",[],"{'question_type': 'simple', 'seed_document_id': 23, 'topic': 'Automated Employment Decision Tools', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}",A bias audit for automated employment decision tools is conducted to ensure that these tools do not unfairly discriminate against certain groups. This involves an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor to assess the tool's disparate impact on various demographic categories. The goal is to identify and mitigate any biases that could lead to unfair employment decisions.,True,The agent's answer captures the essence of the ground truth by explaining that a bias audit is conducted to ensure that automated employment decision tools do not unfairly discriminate against certain groups and to assess the tool's disparate impact on various demographic categories. The agent's answer is more detailed but aligns with the ground truth.,1.0,0.625,0.9946330481105388,1.0,4.0,"The generated answer correctly addresses the purpose of a bias audit and its focus on disparate impact, but it could be slightly more concise and specific regarding the reporting requirements mentioned in the reference answer."
What are the requirements for the published results of the bias audit?,The requirements for the published results of the required bias audit are clarified in the new rules. These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category that is required to be reported to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to determine an impact ratio.,"Document 9: 4 
 
iii. 
at any point during the bias audit, has a direct financial interest or a material indirect 
financial interest in an employer or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to 
use the  AEDT or in a vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT. 
 
Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.  
 
 
 
    _________selection rate for a category________  
Impact Ratio =        selection rate of the most selected category  
 
OR 
 
  
 
     ______scoring rate for a category__________  
Impact Ratio =        scoring rate of the highest scoring category 
 
 
Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;",[],"{'question_type': 'simple', 'seed_document_id': 9, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","The published results of the bias audit must include:

move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and,

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex', 'seed_document_id': 11, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","### Specific Calculations and Requirements for Conducting a Bias Audit of an AEDT

1. **Selection Rate Calculation**:
   - Calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category as required by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).
   - Compare these rates to the most selected category to determine an impact ratio.

2. **Median Score Calculation**:
   - Calculate the median score for the full sample of applicants.
   - Calculate the scoring rate for individuals in each category.

3. **Independent Auditor**:
   - The audit must be conducted by an independent auditor who does not have any employment or financial interest in the employer, employment agency, or AEDT vendor.

### Categories to be Considered for a Bias Audit of an AEDT

1. **Sex Categories**:
   - Impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs. female candidates.

2. **Race/Ethnicity Categories**:
   - Impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino candidates vs. Black or African American (Not Hispanic or Latino) candidates.

3. **Intersectional Categories**:
   - Impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American female candidates.

### Conditions for Using Historical Data or Test Data

1. **Historical Data**:
   - Historical data must be used for a bias audit.
   - An individual employer or employment agency can rely on a bias audit that uses the historical data of other employers or employment agencies if:
     - They have provided their own historical data to the independent auditor.
     - They have never used the AEDT before.

2. **Test Data**:
   - If insufficient historical data is available to conduct a statistically significant bias audit, test data can be used.
   - The summary of results must explain why historical data was not used.
   - The summary must describe how the test data was generated and obtained.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed explanation of the bias audit process, including selection rate calculation, median score calculation, and the role of an independent auditor. However, it does not fully align with the ground truth, which specifies the minimum requirements for a bias audit: calculating the selection rate and impact ratio for each category, including sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectional categories, and indicating the number of individuals not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category. The agent's answer includes additional details not mentioned in the ground truth and misses the requirement to indicate the number of individuals in unknown categories.",1.0,0.6666666666666666,0.9683260135450328,1.0,4.0,"The generated answer correctly addresses the components of the user query, providing detailed calculations and requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT, but it includes some minor inaccuracies regarding the specifics of the conditions for using historical data."
What is the definition of 'Impact Ratio' and how is it calculated in relation to the selection rate or scoring rate of different categories?,"The 'Impact Ratio' can be calculated either as the selection rate for a category divided by the selection rate of the most selected category, or as the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the highest scoring category.","Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

at any point during the bias audit, has a direct financial interest or a material indirect 
financial interest in an employer or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to 
use the  AEDT or in a vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT. 
 
Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.  
 
 
 
    _________selection rate for a category________

     ______scoring rate for a category__________  
Impact Ratio =        scoring rate of the highest scoring category 
 
 
Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion

§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex', 'seed_document_id': 11, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","### Requirements for Conducting a Bias Audit for an AEDT:

1. **Selection Rate Calculation**: The bias audit must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category as required by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) EEO Component 1 report.
2. **Impact Ratio Comparison**: The selection rates must be compared to the most selected category to determine an impact ratio.
3. **Consistency with EEOC Guidelines**: The calculations must be consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures.
4. **Independent Auditor**: The audit must be conducted by an independent auditor who is not employed by or financially interested in the employer, employment agency, or the vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT.

New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection 
 
Notice of Adoption of Final Rule 
 
Pursuant to the authority vested in the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection by 
Sections 1043 and 2203(f) of the New York City Charter and Section 20-104(b) of the New York City 
Administrative Code, and in accordance with the requirements of Section 1043 of the New York City Charter, 
the Department amends Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York.  
 
An initial version of this rule was proposed and published on September 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on 
November 4, 2022, and comments regarding the rule were received. DCWP proposed a second version of this 
rule on December 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on January 23, 2023, and comments regarding the rule 
were received.  
 
Statement of Basis and Purpose 
 
The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP” or “Department”) is adding rules to implement 
new legislation regarding automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”). Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits 
employers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has 
been subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly 
available, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   
 
These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of

calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency

to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex', 'seed_document_id': 15, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","### Steps for Conducting a Bias Audit of an AEDT

1. **Timing**: Ensure the bias audit is conducted no more than a year before the planned use of the AEDT.
2. **Data Collection**: Collect historical data regarding applicant selection from multiple employers.
3. **Independent Auditor**: Provide this data to an independent auditor who does not have a financial interest in the employer, employment agency, or the vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT.
4. **Median Score Calculation**: The auditor must calculate the median score for the full sample of applicants.
5. **Scoring Rate Calculation**: The auditor must also calculate the scoring rate for individuals in each category.

### Criteria for Conducting a Bias Audit of an AEDT

1. **Selection Rate Calculation**: Calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category required to be reported to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).
2. **Impact Ratio Comparison**: Compare these selection rates to the most selected category to determine an impact ratio.
3. **Independent Auditor**: The audit must be conducted by an independent auditor.
4. **Timing**: The audit must be conducted no more than a year before the planned use of the AEDT.

### Calculating Impact Ratios for Different Categories

1. **Determine the Scoring Rate for Each Category**: Calculate the percentage of individuals in each category who meet the selection criteria. This is done by dividing the number of individuals who meet the criteria by the total number of individuals in that category.

2. **Identify the Highest Scoring Rate**: Find the category with the highest scoring rate. This will be used as the reference category.

3. **Calculate the Impact Ratio**: For each category, divide the scoring rate of that category by the scoring rate of the reference category. The formula is:
   \[
   \text{Impact Ratio} = \frac{\text{Scoring Rate of Category}}{\text{Scoring Rate of Reference Category}}
   \]

4. **Separate Calculations for Different Categories**:
   - **Sex Categories**: Calculate the impact ratio for male vs. female candidates.
   - **Race/Ethnicity Categories**: Calculate the impact ratio for each race/ethnicity category compared to the reference category.
   - **Intersectional Categories**: Calculate the impact ratio for combinations of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., Hispanic or Latino male vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American female).

5. **Exclude Categories with Less than 2% Representation**: If a category represents less than 2% of the data, it can be excluded from the calculations. The exclusion must be justified, and the number of applicants and their scoring or selection rate must be reported.

6. **Report the Number of Individuals in Unknown Categories**: Indicate how many individuals were assessed but not included in the calculations due to unknown category information.

By following these steps and criteria, you can systematically conduct a bias audit of an AEDT and calculate the impact ratios for various categories.",True,"The agent's answer provides a detailed and comprehensive explanation of the steps and criteria for conducting a bias audit of an AEDT, including the calculation of impact ratios for different categories such as sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectional categories.

What information does an employer or employment agency need to make publicly available before using an AEDT?,"Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency must make publicly available on the employment section of their website the date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results. The summary should include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT that fall within an unknown category, and the number of applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios for all categories. Additionally, the distribution date of the AEDT must also be provided.","Document 20: The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.

(2) Provide notice in a job posting at least 10 business days before use of an AEDT; or, 
(3) Provide notice via U.S. mail or e-mail at least 10 business days before use of an AEDT.  
(d) To comply with § 20-871(b)(3) of the Code, an employer or employment agency must: 
(1) Provide information on the employment section of its website in a clear and conspicuous 
manner about its AEDT data retention policy, the type of data collected for the AEDT, and the 
source of the data; 
(2) Post instructions on the employment section of its website in a clear and conspicuous manner 
for how to make a written request for such information, and if a written request is received, 
provide such information within 30 days; and

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex', 'seed_document_id': 13, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","The role of the Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT) in conducting bias audits is to ensure that the tool used for screening resumes and scheduling interviews is evaluated for fairness. The bias audit must be conducted no more than a year before the AEDT's use and involves calculating the selection rate and impact ratio for various categories such as sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectional categories. This process helps to identify and mitigate any potential biases in the AEDT's selection process.

Regarding the requirements for using historical data in bias audits:

1. **Historical Data Source**: The historical data can come from one or more employers or employment agencies that use the AEDT.
2. **Data Sharing**: An individual employer or employment agency can rely on a bias audit using historical data from other employers or agencies only if they have provided their own historical data to the independent auditor or if they have never used the AEDT.
3. **Insufficient Historical Data**: If insufficient historical data is available, test data may be used. However, the summary of results must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data was generated and obtained.",True,"The agent's answer correctly explains the role of the AEDT in conducting bias audits and the requirements for using historical data.

The term ""employment decision"" means to screen candidates for employment or employees for promotion within the city.

### Requirements for Using an Automated Employment Decision Tool
1. **Bias Audit**: The tool must have undergone a bias audit within one year prior to its use.
2. **Public Disclosure**: A summary of the most recent bias audit results and the distribution date of the tool must be made publicly available on the employer or employment agency's website before the tool is used.

Additionally, employers or employment agencies must notify each employee or candidate residing in the city of the following:

1. **Notification of Use**: That an automated employment decision tool will be used in their assessment or evaluation, with the notice given at least ten business days before its use, allowing the candidate to request an alternative selection process or accommodation.
2. **Job Qualifications and Characteristics**: The job qualifications and characteristics that the tool will use in the assessment, with the notice given at least ten business days before its use.
3. **Data Information**: If not disclosed on the employer or employment agency’s website, information about the type of data collected for the tool, the source of such data, and the data retention policy must be available upon written request by a candidate or employee, provided within 30 days of the request.

"What are the specific calculations and requirements that must be performed during a bias audit of an AEDT for selection rates, impact ratios, and categories of sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectionality?","A bias audit of an AEDT must, at a minimum, calculate the selection rate for each category, calculate the impact ratio for each category, ensure that the calculations separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories, and indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT that are not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category.","Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Document 6: 2 
 
 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.

Notice of Adoption of Final Rule 
 
Pursuant to the authority vested in the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection by 
Sections 1043 and 2203(f) of the New York City Charter and Section 20-104(b) of the New York City 
Administrative Code, and in accordance with the requirements of Section 1043 of the New York City Charter, 
the Department amends Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York.  
 
An initial version of this rule was proposed and published on September 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on 
November 4, 2022, and comments regarding the rule were received. DCWP proposed a second version of this 
rule on December 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on January 23, 2023, and comments regarding the rule 
were received.  
 
Statement of Basis and Purpose 
 
The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP” or “Department”) is adding rules to implement 
new legislation regarding automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”). Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits 
employers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has 
been subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly 
available, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   
 
These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

Document 7: 3 
 
Section 1.  Chapter 5 of Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York is amended to add Subchapter T to read 
as follows: 
Subchapter T: Automated Employment Decision Tools 
§ 5-300. Definitions. 
As used in this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings: 
 
Automated Employment Decision Tool. “Automated employment decision tool” or “AEDT” means 
“Automated employment decision tool” as defined by § 20-870 of the Code where the phrase “to 
substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making” means: 
i. 
to rely solely on a simplified output (score, tag, classification, ranking, etc.), with no other 
factors considered; or 
ii. 
 to use a simplified output as one of a set of criteria where the simplified output is weighted 
more than any other criterion in the set; or   
iii. 
to use a simplified output to overrule conclusions derived from other factors including 
human decision-making.  
  
Bias Audit. “Bias audit” means “Bias audit” as defined by § 20-870 of the Code.  
 
Candidate for Employment. “Candidate for employment” means a person who has applied for a specific 
employment position by submitting the necessary information or items in the format required by the 
employer or employment agency.  
 
Category. “Category” means any component 1 category required to be reported by employers pursuant 
to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States Code as specified in part 1602.7 of 
title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, as designated on the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission Employer Information Report EEO-1. 
 
Code. “Code” means the Administrative Code of the City of New York. 
 
Distribution Date. “Distribution date” means the date the employer or employment agency began using 
a specific AEDT.  
 
Employment Decision. “Employment decision” means “Employment decision” as defined by § 20-870 
of the Code. 
 
Employment Agency. “Employment agency” means “Employment agency” as defined by 6 RCNY § 5-
249.  
 
Historical data.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex', 'seed_document_id': 4, 'topic': 'Automated Employment Decision Tools', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","A ""bias audit"" in the context of automated employment decision tools is an impartial evaluation conducted by an independent auditor. This audit involves testing the automated tool to assess its disparate impact on individuals based on various categories, such as those required to be reported by employers under specific federal regulations.",False,"The agent's answer provides a general explanation of what a bias audit is, but it does not match the specific definition given in the ground truth, which refers to a legal definition from § 20-870 of the Code.",0.0,1.0,0.974041656,1.0,4.0,"The generated answer correctly explains the concept of a ""bias audit"" in the context of automated employment decision tools, addressing the query well, but it does not directly reference the specific definition from the Code as mentioned in the reference answer."
What is the distinction between historical data and test data in the context of conducting a bias audit for an AEDT?,Test data refers to data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.,"Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino

iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American

§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or

to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex', 'seed_document_id': 18, 'topic': 'Others', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","In the context of conducting a bias audit for an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT):

1. **Historical Data**:
   - **Definition**: Historical data refers to actual data from the past use of the AEDT by one or more employers or employment agencies.
   - **Usage**: This data is used to evaluate the AEDT's performance and identify any biases. An individual employer or employment agency can rely on a bias audit that uses historical data from other employers or agencies if they have provided their own historical data to the auditor or if they have never used the AEDT before.

2. **Test Data**:
   - **Definition**: Test data is data that is not historical and is used when there is insufficient historical data available to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.
   - **Usage**: The summary of results of the bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data was generated and obtained. Test data is used to simulate scenarios and evaluate the AEDT's performance in the absence of sufficient historical data.

What are the criteria and calculations required for conducting a bias audit on the published results of an AEDT?,The published results of a bias audit must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category required to be reported to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to determine an impact ratio.,"Document 9: 4 
 
iii. 
at any point during the bias audit, has a direct financial interest or a material indirect 
financial interest in an employer or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to 
use the  AEDT or in a vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT. 
 
Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.  
 
 
 
    _________selection rate for a category________  
Impact Ratio =        selection rate of the most selected category  
 
OR 
 
  
 
     ______scoring rate for a category__________  
Impact Ratio =        scoring rate of the highest scoring category 
 
 
Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;",[],"{'question_type': 'complex', 'seed_document_id': 9, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","### Criteria for Conducting a Bias Audit on AEDT Results

Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or \nemployment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available \nto conduct a statistically significant bias audit.', 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","The Automated Employment Decision Tools (AEDT) are used in bias audits to ensure that these tools do not unfairly discriminate against applicants based on demographic categories such as sex, race, and ethnicity. Specifically, the AEDT assesses the demographic composition of applicants by calculating the selection rate and impact ratio for each category. This includes separate calculations for:

- Sex categories
- Race/ethnicity categories
- Intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race

The audit ensures that these calculations are performed for each group if the AEDT classifies candidates into specified groups. Additionally, the audit indicates the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT who are not included in the required calculations due to falling within an unknown category.

Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.  
 
 
 
    _________selection rate for a category________

Impact Ratio =        scoring rate of the highest scoring category 
 
 
Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.

separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

An AEDT (Automated Employment Decision Tool) is a tool used by employers or employment agencies to select candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion. These tools often use algorithms and data analysis to make decisions about hiring or promoting individuals.

### Process for Calculating the Impact Ratio in a Bias Audit of an AEDT

1. **Calculate the Selection Rate:**
   - Determine the rate at which individuals in each category (e.g., sex, race/ethnicity) are selected to move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by the AEDT.

2. **Calculate the Scoring Rate:**
   - Determine the rate at which individuals in each category receive a score above the sample’s median score.

3. **Calculate the Impact Ratio:**
   - For each category, divide the selection rate or scoring rate by the selection rate or scoring rate of the most selected or highest scoring category, respectively.

4. **Separate Calculations:**
   - Perform these calculations separately for sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race.

5. **Indicate Exclusions:**
   - Indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT who are not included in the required calculations because they fall within an unknown category.

6. **Exclusion of Small Categories:**
   - An independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of the data from the required calculations for impact ratio, provided that the summary of results includes the justification for the exclusion and the number of applicants and scoring or selection rate for the excluded category.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed process for calculating the impact ratio in a bias audit of an AEDT, but it does not specifically mention the requirement to report to the EEOC and compare the selection rates to the most selected category as per Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures.

Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on

What criteria must be met in order to exclude a category from the required calculations for the impact ratio in a bias audit of an AEDT?,"A bias audit of an AEDT must, at a minimum, calculate the selection rate for each category, calculate the impact ratio for each category, ensure that the calculations separately calculate the impact on sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories, and indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT that are not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category.","Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.

ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.",[],"{'question_type': 'distracting element', 'seed_document_id': 5, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': '(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and \n(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of \nthe data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio.

1. **Representation Threshold**: The category must represent less than 2% of the data being used for the bias audit.
2. **Justification**: The summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the exclusion.
3. **Details of Exclusion**: The summary must also include the number of applicants and the scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded category.

The **impact ratio** in a bias audit of an AEDT is a measure used to compare the selection rates of different categories of candidates. It is calculated by dividing the selection rate of a particular category by the selection rate of the most favored category. This ratio helps to identify potential biases in the AEDT by showing how different groups are affected in terms of selection rates. For example, if the selection rate for male candidates is 54.3% and for female candidates is 44.7%, the impact ratio for female candidates would be 0.82 (44.7% / 54.3%).",False,"The agent's answer provides specific criteria for excluding a category from the impact ratio calculations, which is not mentioned in the ground truth.

(1) Calculate the median score for the full sample of applicants;  
(2) Calculate the scoring rate for individuals in each category;

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on:

candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 


   - The employer or employment agency provided historical data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit, or
   - The employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT.

The steps involved in conducting a bias audit of an AEDT using historical data are as follows:

1. **Collection of Historical Data**: Gather historical data from one or more employers or employment agencies that have used the AEDT. This data should include information on applicant selection and other relevant metrics.
2. **Provision of Data to Independent Auditor**: The historical data collected must be provided to an independent auditor. If an individual employer or employment agency is relying on a bias audit using data from other employers, they must either provide their own historical data or have never used the AEDT before.
3. **Conducting the Bias Audit**: The independent auditor uses the historical data to conduct the bias audit. This involves analyzing the data to identify any biases in the AEDT's decision-making process.
4. **Reporting Results**: The results of the bias audit, including metrics such as selection rates and impact ratios for different categories (e.g., sex categories), are summarized and reported. This summary should explain the findings and any identified biases.

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.

1. **Fairness and Non-Discrimination**: It ensures that the selection rates for each race/ethnicity and sex category are fair and non-discriminatory. This helps in identifying and addressing any potential biases in the tool's decision-making process.

2. **Regulatory Compliance**: It ensures compliance with regulations, promoting equal employment opportunities. Employers are required to report certain categories to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), and a bias audit helps in adhering to these requirements.

3. **Impact Ratio Analysis**: By comparing the selection rates to the most selected category and calculating the impact ratio, employers can detect and mitigate any adverse impacts on specific groups. This fosters a more inclusive and equitable hiring process.

Regarding the **component 1 category** in employment reporting, it refers to any category required to be reported by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States Code.

What are the requirements for conducting a bias audit of an AEDT used to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job posting?,"The requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT include calculating the selection rate for each category, calculating the impact ratio for each category, separately calculating the impact of the AEDT on sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race, performing the calculations for each group if the AEDT classifies candidates into specified groups, and indicating the number of individuals not included in the calculations due to falling within an unknown category.","Document 14: Data 
on those individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
(c) Where an AEDT scores candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion, a bias 
audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the median score for the full sample of applicants;  
(2) Calculate the scoring rate for individuals in each category;

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT;

Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.  
 
 
 
    _________selection rate for a category________

Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above

Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations

 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT;

The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit;

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.

"I'm considering using an AEDT for the first time. Can I rely on a bias audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or can I conduct a bias audit using test data? What is the definition of 'test data' in the context of a bias audit?",'Test data' refers to data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.,"Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'situational', 'seed_document_id': 18, 'topic': 'Others', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': '{""context"": ""An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time and is seeking information about conducting a bias audit using historical data or test data."", ""description"": ""An employer is considering using an AEDT for the first time and wants to know if they can rely on a bias audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or if they can conduct a bias audit using test data.""}', 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","### Can I rely on a bias audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies for AEDT?

Yes, you can rely on a bias audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies for AEDT under certain conditions. If you are an employer or employment agency that has never used the AEDT, or if you provide historical data from your own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit, you may rely on such an audit. Additionally, if insufficient historical data is available to conduct a statistically significant bias audit, you may rely on a bias audit that uses test data, provided the summary of results explains why historical data was not used and describes how the test data was generated and obtained.

### Can I conduct a bias audit using test data for AEDT?

Yes, you can conduct a bias audit using test data for an AEDT if there is insufficient historical data available to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. The summary of results of the bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data was generated and obtained.

### What is the definition of 'test data' in the context of a bias audit?

Test data is defined as data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.",True,,1.0,1.0,0.8902729509094991,0.9999999999666668,3.0,"The generated answer correctly addresses the definition of 'test data' but includes unnecessary details about bias audits that may not directly relate to the user's query, leading to minor inaccuracies in the overall context."

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or

to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection 
 
Notice of Adoption of Final Rule 
 
Pursuant to the authority vested in the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection by 
Sections 1043 and 2203(f) of the New York City Charter and Section 20-104(b) of the New York City 
Administrative Code, and in accordance with the requirements of Section 1043 of the New York City Charter, 
the Department amends Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York.  
 
An initial version of this rule was proposed and published on September 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on 
November 4, 2022, and comments regarding the rule were received. DCWP proposed a second version of this 
rule on December 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on January 23, 2023, and comments regarding the rule 
were received.  
 
Statement of Basis and Purpose 
 
The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP” or “Department”) is adding rules to implement 
new legislation regarding automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”). Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits 
employers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has 
been subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly 
available, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   
 
These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

Can you explain the meaning of test data in the context of a bias audit according to Local Law 144 and other policy documents?,Test data refers to data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.,"Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'situational', 'seed_document_id': 18, 'topic': 'Others', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': '{""description"": ""I am a legal chatbot for Local Law 144 and other policy documents.""}', 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","In the context of a bias audit according to Local Law 144 and other policy documents, ""test data"" refers to data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of

sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Document 6: 2 
 
 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.

data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.  
 
 
 
    _________selection rate for a category________

Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT;

I'm reviewing policy documents related to bias audits and I'm seeking clarification on the definition of 'Impact Ratio'. Can you explain what 'Impact Ratio' means?,"The 'Impact Ratio' can be calculated as either the selection rate for a category divided by the selection rate of the most selected category, or the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the highest scoring category.","Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification,

New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection 
 
Notice of Adoption of Final Rule 
 
Pursuant to the authority vested in the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection by 
Sections 1043 and 2203(f) of the New York City Charter and Section 20-104(b) of the New York City 
Administrative Code, and in accordance with the requirements of Section 1043 of the New York City Charter, 
the Department amends Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York.  
 
An initial version of this rule was proposed and published on September 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on 
November 4, 2022, and comments regarding the rule were received. DCWP proposed a second version of this 
rule on December 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on January 23, 2023, and comments regarding the rule 
were received.  
 
Statement of Basis and Purpose 
 
The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP” or “Department”) is adding rules to implement 
new legislation regarding automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”). Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits 
employers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has 
been subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly 
available, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   
 
These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

What are the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT and what changes were made in the second version of the proposed rules?,"The requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT include calculating the selection rate and impact ratio for each category. In the second version of the proposed rules, changes were made to the definition of AEDT and the requirements for an independent auditor were clarified.","Document 14: Data 
on those individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
(c) Where an AEDT scores candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion, a bias 
audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the median score for the full sample of applicants;  
(2) Calculate the scoring rate for individuals in each category;

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 


Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.

What are the requirements for a bias audit and what is test data in the context of a bias audit?,The requirements for a bias audit include calculating the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category and comparing the selection rates to determine an impact ratio. Test data in the context of a bias audit refers to data used to conduct the audit that is not historical data.,"Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Document 6: 2 
 
 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.",[],"{'question_type': 'double', 'seed_document_id': 5, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': [{'question': 'What are the requirements for a bias audit?', 'answer': 'A bias audit must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category and compare the selection rates to determine an impact ratio.'}, {'question': 'What is test data in the context of a bias audit?', 'answer': 'Test data is data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.'}], 'fake_fact': None}","### Requirements for a Bias Audit

1. **Selection Rate Calculation**: The audit must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category as required by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).
2. **Impact Ratio Comparison**: These selection rates must be compared to the most selected category to determine an impact ratio.
3. **Independent Auditor**: The audit must be conducted by an independent auditor who does not have a financial interest in the employer, employment agency, or vendor that developed or distributed the Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT).
4. **Publication of Results**: The results of the bias audit must be published.
5. **Notices to Employees and Candidates**: Employers and employment agencies must provide notices to employees and candidates for employment about the bias audit.

### Test Data in the Context of a Bias Audit

Test data refers to data used to conduct a bias audit when there is insufficient historical data available to perform a statistically significant audit. The use of test data must be justified, and the summary of results should:

1. **Explain the Lack of Historical Data**: Provide reasons why historical data was not used.
2. **Describe Test Data Generation**: Explain how the test data was generated and obtained.",True,The agent's answer provides a detailed and accurate explanation of the requirements for a bias audit and the concept of test data in the context of a bias audit.

may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

The purpose of a bias audit is to ensure that an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT) is not biased in its screening processes. This involves evaluating historical or test data to check for any disparities in selection rates among different groups, such as by sex, to ensure fairness and compliance with regulations.

### When an Employer Can Rely on a Bias Audit
An employer can rely on a bias audit in the following circumstances:

1. **First-Time Use of AEDT**: If the employer is using an AEDT for the first time, they may rely on a bias audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit conducted using test data.

2. **Sufficient Historical Data**: If the employer has been using the AEDT and has sufficient historical data from its own use, they may rely on a bias audit conducted using this historical data.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.

An ""Automated Employment Decision Tool"" is defined as any computational process derived from machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence that issues simplified output, such as a score, classification, or recommendation. This output is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons. This term does not include tools that do not automate, support, substantially assist, or replace discretionary decision-making processes and do not materially impact natural persons, such as junk email filters, firewalls, antivirus software, calculators, spreadsheets, databases, data sets, or other compilations of data.

### Bias Audit
A bias audit is an evaluation process that involves analyzing the performance of an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT) to ensure it does not exhibit discriminatory biases. This audit must be conducted at least once a year and includes calculating the selection rate and impact ratio for various categories such as sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectional categories. The audit ensures that the AEDT's impact on different groups is measured and reported, and it also accounts for individuals who fall within unknown categories.",False,The agent's answer is mostly correct but includes additional details not present in the ground truth and misses the requirement for an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor for the bias audit.,1.0,0.9117647058823528,0.9095378238463636,1.0,4.0,"The generated answer accurately defines both 'Automated Employment Decision Tool' and 'Bias audit' with minimal errors, but it includes some unnecessary details that do not affect the overall correctness."
What are the requirements for a bias audit and what is test data?,The requirements for a bias audit include calculating the selection rate and impact ratio for each category. Test data is the data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.,"Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Document 6: 2 
 
 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.

may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT.

A bias audit is an evaluation process that involves analyzing the selection rates and impact ratios of an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT) to ensure it does not disproportionately favor or disadvantage any particular group. This audit must be conducted at least once a year and includes calculations for sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectional categories. The audit also identifies the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT who are not included in these calculations due to unknown categories.

### Information to be Publicly Available Before Using an AEDT

Before using an AEDT, an employer or employment agency must make the following information publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:

1. **Date of the Most Recent Bias Audit and Summary of Results:**
   - Source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit.
   - Number of individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category.
   - Number of applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios for all categories.

2. **Distribution Date of the AEDT:**

Additionally, the summary of results and distribution date must be kept posted for at least 6 months after the latest use of the AEDT for an employment decision.",True,"The agent's answer accurately describes what a bias audit is and the information that should be publicly available before using an AEDT.

The term ""employment decision"" refers to the process of screening candidates for employment or employees for promotion within a city.

### Requirements for Using an Automated Employment Decision Tool
1. **Bias Audit**: The tool must have undergone a bias audit within one year prior to its use.
2. **Public Disclosure**: A summary of the most recent bias audit results and the distribution date of the tool must be made publicly available on the employer or employment agency's website before the tool is used.

Additionally, employers or employment agencies must provide the following notices to employees or candidates residing in the city:
1. **Notification**: Inform candidates that an automated employment decision tool will be used in their assessment or evaluation at least ten business days before its use. This notice should also allow the candidate to request an alternative selection process or accommodation.
2. **Job Qualifications and Characteristics**: Provide information on the job qualifications and characteristics that the tool will use in the assessment at least ten business days before its use.
3. **Data Information**: Upon written request, provide information about the type of data collected by the tool, the source of the data, and the data retention policy within 30 days of the request. This is unless such disclosure would violate local, state, or federal law, or interfere with a law enforcement investigation.",True,"The agent's answer correctly defines 'employment decision' and outlines the requirements for using an automated employment decision tool, including the need for a bias audit and public disclosure.

What are the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT and what is test data?,The requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT are to calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category and compare the selection rates to determine an impact ratio. Test data is data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.,"Document 6: 2 
 
 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results. 
 
New material is underlined. 
[Deleted material is in brackets.] 
 
“Shall” and “must” denote mandatory requirements and may be used interchangeably in the rules of this 
department, unless otherwise specified or unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.",[],"{'question_type': 'double', 'seed_document_id': 6, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': [{'question': 'What are the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT?', 'answer': 'A bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category and compare the selection rates to determine an impact ratio.'}, {'question': 'What is test data?', 'answer': 'Test data is data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.'}], 'fake_fact': None}","### Requirements for a Bias Audit of an AEDT

1. **Selection Rate Calculation**: The audit must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category as required by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report.
2. **Impact Ratio Comparison**: The selection rates must be compared to the most selected category to determine an impact ratio.
3. **Independent Auditor**: The audit must be conducted by an independent auditor who does not have any employment or financial interest in the employer, employment agency, or the vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT.
4. **Timeliness**: The audit must be conducted no more than a year before the planned use of the AEDT.
5. **Publication of Results**: The results of the bias audit must be published.
6. **Notification**: Employers and employment agencies must provide notices to employees and candidates for employment regarding the use of the AEDT.

### Test Data

Test data refers to data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. It is utilized when there is insufficient historical data available to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",True,The agent's answer provides a detailed and accurate explanation of the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT and the definition of test data. It includes all the key points mentioned in the ground truth and expands on them with additional relevant details.,1.0,0.2857142857142857,0.9681828221401356,1.0,5.0,"The generated answer accurately covers all components of the user query regarding the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT and correctly defines test data, providing comprehensive and relevant information without any errors."
What is the purpose of a bias audit and under what circumstances can an employer rely on it using historical data from other employers?,The purpose of a bias audit is to calculate the impact ratio and selection rate of an AEDT on different categories. An employer can rely on a bias audit using historical data from other employers if they provided their own historical data or if they have never used the AEDT.,"Document 17: 8

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.",[],"{'question_type': 'double', 'seed_document_id': 17, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': [{'question': 'What is the purpose of a bias audit?', 'answer': 'A bias audit is conducted to calculate the impact ratio and selection rate of an AEDT on different categories such as sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectional categories.'}, {'question': 'Under what circumstances can an employer rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from other employers?', 'answer': 'An employer can rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses historical data from other employers if they provided their own historical data or if they have never used the AEDT.'}], 'fake_fact': None}","A bias audit serves to ensure that an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT) is not biased in its screening processes. This involves evaluating historical or test data to check for any disparities in selection rates among different groups, such as by sex, to ensure fairness and compliance with regulations.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.",[],"{'question_type': 'out of scope', 'seed_document_id': 17, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': 'The AEDT is a software developed by a team of engineers.'}","The information about who developed the AEDT software is not available in the current context.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.



and candidates for employment; and  


comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;",[],"{'question_type': 'out of scope', 'seed_document_id': 12, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': 'The vendor provides historical data for the past 10 years.'}","The vendor provides historical data collected from multiple employers, but the specific number of years is not specified.",False,"The agent's answer implies that the number of years is unspecified, while the ground truth states that there is no sufficient information to answer the question.

 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

[Deleted material is in brackets.] 
 
“Shall” and “must” denote mandatory requirements and may be used interchangeably in the rules of this 
department, unless otherwise specified or unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required

(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.",[],"{'question_type': 'out of scope', 'seed_document_id': 17, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': 'The scoring rate for Hispanic or Latino females is 90%.'}",The scoring rate for Hispanic or Latino females is 50%.,False,The agent provided a specific percentage (50%) without any context or data to support it.

Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.  
 
 
 
    _________selection rate for a category________  
Impact Ratio =        selection rate of the most selected category  
 
OR 
 
  
 
     ______scoring rate for a category__________  
Impact Ratio =        scoring rate of the highest scoring category 
 
 
Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.

(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;",[],"{'question_type': 'out of scope', 'seed_document_id': 9, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': 'John, who developed the AEDT, has a direct financial interest in the AEDT.'}","The available information does not specify whether John, who developed the AEDT, has a direct financial interest in it.",True,,1.0,0.6666666666666666,0.0,0.0,4.0,"The generated answer correctly addresses the user's query by indicating that the information is not specified, but it could be slightly clearer in stating that the context does not provide sufficient information."

 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

“Shall” and “must” denote mandatory requirements and may be used interchangeably in the rules of this 
department, unless otherwise specified or unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.",[],"{'question_type': 'out of scope', 'seed_document_id': 6, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': 'The majority of the comments received were in favor of the proposed rule.'}","The general sentiment of the comments received about the proposed rule was constructive, leading to various changes in the final rules.

these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'out of scope', 'seed_document_id': 13, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': 'The average age of the male applicants in the White category is 35.'}","The data provided does not include information on the ages of the applicants.

Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the

Document 0: Subchapter 25: Automated Employment Decision Tools
§ 20-870 Definitions.
For the purposes of this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings:
   Automated employment decision tool. The term ""automated employment decision tool"" means any computational process, derived from machine
learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence, that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation,
that is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons. The term
""automated employment decision tool"" does not include a tool that does not automate, support, substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-
making processes and that does not materially impact natural persons, including, but not limited to, a junk email filter, firewall, antivirus software,
calculator, spreadsheet, database, data set, or other compilation of data.
   Bias audit. The term ""bias audit"" means an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor. Such bias audit shall include but not be limited to the
testing of an automated employment decision tool to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported
by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of
federal regulations.
   Employment decision. The term ""employment decision"" means to screen candidates for employment or employees for promotion within the city.
(L.L. 2021/144, 12/11/2021, eff. 1/1/2023)
§ 20-871 Requirements for automated employment decision tools.
   a.   In the city, it shall be unlawful for an employer or an employment agency to use an automated employment decision tool to screen a candidate or
employee for an employment decision unless:
      1.   Such tool has been the subject of a bias audit conducted no more than one year prior to the use of such tool; and
      2.   A summary of the results of the most recent bias audit of such tool as well as the distribution date of the tool to which such audit applies has been
made publicly available on the website of the employer or employment agency prior to the use of such tool.

posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit. The vendor provides historical data regarding 
applicant selection that the vendor has collected from multiple employers to an independent auditor who 
will conduct a bias audit as follows:

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;",[],"{'question_type': 'out of scope', 'seed_document_id': 12, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': 'The impact ratio for female applicants is 0.950.'}","The impact ratio for female applicants varies by race/ethnicity as follows:

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;",[],"{'question_type': 'out of scope', 'seed_document_id': 12, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': 'The vendor provides historical data regarding applicant salary.'}","The vendor provides historical data regarding applicant selection, which includes:

§ 20-870 Definitions.
For the purposes of this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings:
   Automated employment decision tool. The term ""automated employment decision tool"" means any computational process, derived from machine
learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence, that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation,
that is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons. The term
""automated employment decision tool"" does not include a tool that does not automate, support, substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-
making processes and that does not materially impact natural persons, including, but not limited to, a junk email filter, firewall, antivirus software,
calculator, spreadsheet, database, data set, or other compilation of data.
   Bias audit. The term ""bias audit"" means an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor. Such bias audit shall include but not be limited to the
testing of an automated employment decision tool to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported
by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of
federal regulations.

What is the relationship between the definition of 'test data' in a bias audit and the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT?,"In a bias audit, 'test data' refers to the data used for the audit that is not historical data. On the other hand, a bias audit of an AEDT requires calculating the selection rate and impact ratio for each category, including sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectional categories. Therefore, the definition of 'test data' in a bias audit is distinct from the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT, but both are crucial components of ensuring fairness and identifying potential biases in automated systems.","Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12

audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit.

(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of

   - Test data refers to data used to conduct the bias audit that is not historical data. This means it is specifically generated or selected for the purpose of evaluating the tool's performance and potential biases.

2. **Requirements for a Bias Audit of an AEDT**:
   - The bias audit must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category as required by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report.

   - Employers and employment agencies must provide notices to employees and candidates for employment.

**Relationship**:
- The 'test data' is crucial for conducting the bias audit as it provides the necessary data to evaluate the AEDT's performance across different demographic categories.
- The requirements for the bias audit of an AEDT ensure that the audit is thorough, unbiased, and transparent, using the 'test data' to calculate selection rates and impact ratios.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of

The data requirements for a bias audit involve using historical data of the AEDT. However, if there is insufficient historical data available, an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data. In both cases, the goal is to evaluate any potential biases and disparities in the AEDT's impact on different categories.","Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'compare', 'seed_document_id': 11, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': [{'question': 'What is a bias audit?', 'answer': 'A bias audit is a process used to assess the impact of an AEDT on different categories, such as sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectional categories.'}, {'question': 'What are the data requirements for a bias audit?', 'answer': 'A bias audit must use historical data of the AEDT, but if insufficient historical data is available, an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data.'}], 'fake_fact': None}","The data requirements for a bias audit and the process of assessing the impact of an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT) on different categories are closely related. Here's how they connect:

### Data Requirements for a Bias Audit:
1. **Historical Data**: The audit must use historical data from one or more employers or employment agencies that have used the AEDT. If historical data is insufficient, test data can be used, but the summary must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data was generated and obtained.
2. **Scoring Data**: For AEDTs that score candidates, the audit must calculate the median score for the full sample of applicants and the scoring rate for individuals in each category.

### Process of Assessing the Impact of an AEDT:
1. **Selection Rate Calculation**: Determine the selection rate for each category.
2. **Scoring Rate Calculation**: Determine the scoring rate for each category.
3. **Impact Ratio Calculation**: Calculate the impact ratio for each category.
4. **Category Assessment**: Assess the impact separately for sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race.
5. **Data Exclusion**: Indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT who are not included in the required calculations because they fall within an unknown category. Categories representing less than 2% of the data can be excluded from impact ratio calculations, with justification and details provided in the summary.

### Connection:
- **Historical and Test Data**: Both the bias audit and the impact assessment rely on historical or test data to perform their calculations.
- **Scoring and Selection Rates**: The bias audit requires the calculation of median scores and scoring rates, which are also essential for assessing the impact on different categories.
- **Impact Ratios and Category Analysis**: The process of assessing the impact involves calculating impact ratios and analyzing different categories, which aligns with the data requirements for a bias audit to ensure fairness and transparency.

Section 1.  Chapter 5 of Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York is amended to add Subchapter T to read 
as follows: 
Subchapter T: Automated Employment Decision Tools 
§ 5-300. Definitions. 
As used in this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings: 
 
Automated Employment Decision Tool. “Automated employment decision tool” or “AEDT” means 
“Automated employment decision tool” as defined by § 20-870 of the Code where the phrase “to 
substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making” means: 
i. 
to rely solely on a simplified output (score, tag, classification, ranking, etc.), with no other 
factors considered; or

### Definition:
An **automated employment decision tool** is any computational process derived from machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence that issues simplified outputs (e.g., scores, classifications, or recommendations) to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-making in employment decisions affecting natural persons. This excludes tools that do not automate or materially impact discretionary decision-making processes, such as junk email filters, firewalls, antivirus software, calculators, spreadsheets, databases, or data sets.

### Requirements:
To use an automated employment decision tool, the following requirements must be met:

1. **Bias Audit**: The tool must have undergone a bias audit within the past year.
2. **Public Disclosure**: A summary of the most recent bias audit results and the distribution date of the tool must be publicly available on the employer or employment agency's website before the tool is used.
3. **Notification to Candidates/Employees**:
   - Candidates or employees must be notified at least ten business days in advance that an automated employment decision tool will be used in their assessment or evaluation. This allows them to request an alternative selection process or accommodation.
   - The job qualifications and characteristics that the tool will use in the assessment must be disclosed at least ten business days in advance.
   - If not disclosed on the website, information about the type of data collected, the source of the data, and the data retention policy must be provided upon written request within 30 days, unless such disclosure would violate laws or interfere with law enforcement investigations.

### Relationship:
The definition sets the scope of what constitutes an automated employment decision tool, while the requirements ensure that the use of such tools is conducted in a manner that is transparent, fair, and accountable. The bias audit and public disclosure requirements aim to mitigate potential biases and ensure that the tool's impact on employment decisions is scrutinized and understood. The notification requirements ensure that affected individuals are informed and have the opportunity to seek alternatives or accommodations, thereby promoting fairness and transparency in the employment process.",True,"The agent's answer provides a detailed explanation of the definition and requirements for using an automated employment decision tool. It covers the key points mentioned in the ground truth, such as the definition involving computational processes and the requirement for a bias audit within the past year. Additionally, the agent elaborates on transparency, fairness, and accountability, which align with the legal restrictions and conditions for use mentioned in the ground truth.",1.0,0.6451612903225806,0.9999999999999998,0.9999999999666668,4.0,"The generated answer provides a comprehensive definition and detailed requirements for using an automated employment decision tool, correctly addressing the relationship between them, though it could be slightly more concise."
"What is the relationship between test data and the requirements for a bias audit, and how do they differ?","Test data refers to the data used specifically for conducting a bias audit, which is not historical data. On the other hand, the requirements for a bias audit include calculating the selection rate and impact ratio for various categories, such as sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectional categories. While test data is a subset of the data used in a bias audit, the requirements for a bias audit involve specific calculations and analysis of different categories to identify and address biases.","Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT.

to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'compare', 'seed_document_id': 18, 'topic': 'Others', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': [{'question': 'What is the definition of test data?', 'answer': 'Test data means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.'}, {'question': 'What are the requirements for a bias audit?', 'answer': 'A bias audit must calculate the selection rate and impact ratio for each category, including sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories.'}], 'fake_fact': None}","### Relationship Between Test Data and Requirements for a Bias Audit

Test data is used in a bias audit when there is insufficient historical data available to conduct a statistically significant audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data was generated and obtained. This allows an employer or employment agency to still conduct a bias audit even if they lack sufficient historical data.

### Differences Between Test Data and Requirements for a Bias Audit

- **Test Data**: Refers to data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. It is generated and obtained specifically for the purpose of the audit when historical data is insufficient.
  
- **Requirements for a Bias Audit**: Typically mandate the use of historical data from the Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT), which can come from one or more employers or employment agencies that have used the AEDT. If historical data is insufficient, test data can be used, but the audit must include an explanation for why historical data was not used and details on how the test data was generated and obtained.",False,"The agent's answer does not fully address the requirements for a bias audit, which include specific calculations and analysis of different categories to identify and address biases. The agent's answer focuses more on the use of test data when historical data is insufficient, but it does not cover the detailed requirements for a bias audit as mentioned in the ground truth.",1.0,1.0,0.9000451611412403,0.8333333332916666,3.0,"The generated answer partially addresses the relationship and differences between test data and bias audit requirements, but it contains some inaccuracies regarding the necessity of historical data and lacks clarity on specific calculations involved in the audit."
"What are the differences and similarities between 'selection rate' and 'scoring rate', and how do they relate to each other?","'Selection rate' refers to the rate at which individuals are selected or classified in a hiring process or by an AEDT, while 'scoring rate' pertains to the rate at which individuals receive a score above the sample's median score, calculated by an AEDT. Both rates involve evaluating individuals based on certain criteria, but 'selection rate' focuses on advancement in a process, while 'scoring rate' focuses on achieving a score above a threshold. In some cases, the two rates may be related, such as when a higher 'scoring rate' leads to a higher 'selection rate' for certain categories of individuals.","Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

financial interest in an employer or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to 
use the  AEDT or in a vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT. 
 
Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.

Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on

**Selection Rate:**
- **Definition:** The rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to move forward in a process (e.g., hiring) or assigned a classification by an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT).
- **Calculation:** 
  \[
  \text{Selection Rate} = \frac{\text{Number of individuals selected}}{\text{Total number of individuals in the category}}
  \]
  - **Example:** If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40%.

**Scoring Rate:**
- **Definition:** The rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above the sample’s median score, where the score is calculated by an AEDT.
- **Calculation:** 
  \[
  \text{Scoring Rate} = \frac{\text{Number of individuals scoring above the median}}{\text{Total number of individuals in the category}}
  \]

### Similarities
1. **Purpose:** Both metrics are used to evaluate the performance and fairness of AEDTs in employment-related decisions.
2. **Category-Based:** Both rates are calculated for specific categories of individuals (e.g., based on gender, ethnicity).
3. **Numerical Metrics:** Both are expressed as percentages.

### Differences
1. **Focus:**
   - **Selection Rate:** Focuses on the proportion of individuals who move forward in a process or are assigned a classification.
   - **Scoring Rate:** Focuses on the proportion of individuals who score above the median score.
2. **Calculation Basis:**
   - **Selection Rate:** Based on the number of individuals selected out of the total who applied or were considered.
   - **Scoring Rate:** Based on the number of individuals scoring above the median out of the total in the category.

### Relationship
- **Interdependence:** While the selection rate and scoring rate are distinct metrics, they can be related. A high scoring rate in a category might lead to a higher selection rate if the selection process is based on scores.
- **Evaluation:** Both metrics can be used together to evaluate the fairness and effectiveness of AEDTs. For instance, if a particular category has a low selection rate but a high scoring rate, it may indicate potential biases in the selection process beyond just the scoring mechanism.",True,"The agent's answer provides detailed definitions, similarities, differences, and relationships between 'selection rate' and 'scoring rate' that align with the ground truth.

What calculations are required in the bias audit and when can an independent auditor exclude a category from these calculations?,"In the bias audit, calculations include determining the impact ratio for each category and assessing the impact of the AEDT on various demographic categories. An independent auditor can exclude a category from the calculations if it represents less than 2% of the data being used for the audit.","Document 16: (d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and

category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must

   - Compare these selection rates to the most selected category to determine an impact ratio.

2. **Median Score Calculation**:
   - Calculate the median score for the full sample of applicants.

3. **Scoring Rate Calculation**:
   - Calculate the scoring rate for individuals in each category.

### Exclusion of Categories

An independent auditor can exclude a category from the bias audit calculations if the category represents less than 2% of the data being used for the bias audit. The summary of results must include:

What is the relationship between the definition of test data and when an employer or employment agency can rely on a bias audit that uses test data?,"Test data is data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. An employer or employment agency can rely on a bias audit that uses test data if there is insufficient historical data available to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. In other words, test data serves as an alternative when historical data is lacking, allowing employers and employment agencies to still assess and address bias in their processes.","Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;",[],"{'question_type': 'compare', 'seed_document_id': 14, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': [{'question': 'What must be calculated in a bias audit of an AEDT?', 'answer': 'A bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category and compare the selection rates to determine an impact ratio.'}, {'question': 'What are the requirements for the published results of a bias audit?', 'answer': 'The requirements for the published results of a bias audit include providing notices to employees and candidates for employment and clarifying other obligations for the employer or employment agency.'}], 'fake_fact': None}","The relationship between the calculations in a bias audit of an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT) and the requirements for the published results is that the calculations form the basis for meeting the publication requirements.

2. **Impact Ratio**:
   - The impact ratio is a measure used to compare the selection rates of different categories (e.g., sex, race, ethnicity) to identify potential bias.
   - It is calculated by dividing the selection rate of one category by the selection rate of the most selected category.

   - Certain categories might be excluded from the impact ratio if they represent less than 2% of the data used for the audit.
   - When a category is excluded, the independent auditor must provide a justification for the exclusion, along with the number of applicants and the scoring or selection rate for the excluded category.

In summary, the calculations required for a bias audit are essential for determining the impact ratio, which helps identify potential biases in the selection process.

§ 20-870 Definitions.
For the purposes of this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings:
   Automated employment decision tool. The term ""automated employment decision tool"" means any computational process, derived from machine

While both concepts involve making assessments, 'Scoring Rate' focuses on evaluating scores based on a median, while 'Screen' involves evaluating candidates for selection or promotion. They are related in the sense that both involve making judgments or decisions based on certain criteria, but they differ in terms of the specific context and method of assessment.","Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

financial interest in an employer or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to 
use the  AEDT or in a vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT. 
 
Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.

Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve

the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.

**Scoring Rate:**
- **Definition:** The term ""Scoring Rate"" refers to the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT).

**Screen:**
- **Definition:** In this context, ""Screen"" is defined as making a determination about whether a candidate for employment or an employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion process.

### Similarities
1. **Context of Use:** Both terms are used in the context of evaluating individuals, particularly in employment or promotion scenarios.
2. **Decision-Making:** Both involve decision-making processes. ""Scoring Rate"" involves the use of scores to make decisions, while ""Screen"" involves making determinations about advancement or selection.

### Differences
1. **Nature of Evaluation:**
   - **Scoring Rate:** Focuses on the quantitative aspect, specifically the rate at which individuals score above a certain threshold.
   - **Screen:** Focuses on the qualitative aspect, specifically the determination of whether an individual should be selected or advanced.

2. **Tool Involvement:**
   - **Scoring Rate:** Involves the use of an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT) to calculate scores.
   - **Screen:** May or may not involve automated tools; it is more about the decision-making process itself.

### Relationship
- **Interdependency:** The ""Scoring Rate"" can be a factor in the ""Screen"" process. For example, a high scoring rate might influence the decision to advance a candidate in the hiring or promotion process.
- **Sequential Use:** Typically, the scoring rate is determined first using an AEDT, and then the screening process uses this information to make final decisions about selection or advancement.",True,"The agent's answer correctly defines 'Scoring Rate' and 'Screen', explains their similarities and differences, and describes their relationship.

### Definition of Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT):
An AEDT is any computational process derived from machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence that provides simplified outputs (e.g., scores, classifications, or recommendations) used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-making in employment decisions that impact individuals. This does not include tools that do not automate or materially impact discretionary decision-making processes, such as junk email filters, firewalls, antivirus software, calculators, spreadsheets, databases, or data sets.

### Requirements for Using AEDT in the City:
1. **Bias Audit**: The AEDT must have undergone a bias audit within the past year.
2. **Public Disclosure**: A summary of the most recent bias audit results and the distribution date of the tool must be publicly available on the employer or employment agency's website before the tool is used.
3. **Notification to Employees/Candidates**:
   - **Usage Notification**: Employees or candidates residing in the city must be notified at least ten business days before the AEDT is used in their assessment or evaluation. This allows candidates to request an alternative selection process or accommodation.
   - **Job Qualifications and Characteristics**: Information on the job qualifications and characteristics that the AEDT will use in the assessment must be provided at least ten business days before its use.
   - **Data Information**: Upon written request, information about the type of data collected, the source of the data, and the data retention policy must be provided within 30 days of the request, unless such disclosure would violate laws or interfere with law enforcement investigations.

### Relationship:
The definition of AEDT establishes what constitutes an automated tool used in employment decision-making. The requirements for using such a tool ensure that its deployment is transparent, fair, and non-discriminatory. The bias audit and public disclosure aim to mitigate potential biases in the tool, while the notification requirements ensure that candidates are informed and can seek alternatives if necessary. This framework is designed to protect individuals from unfair or opaque automated decision-making processes in employment.",True,"The agent's answer provides a detailed explanation of the definition of 'Automated Employment Decision Tool' and the requirements for using such a tool in the city.

Test data, on the other hand, refers to the data used in a bias audit that is not historical data. Test data is necessary to conduct a bias audit and apply the requirements. In summary, the requirements for a bias audit rely on analyzing selection rates, while test data is the specific type of data used to perform the audit.","Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Document 6: 2 
 
 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and

Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.",[],"{'question_type': 'compare', 'seed_document_id': 5, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': [{'question': 'What are the requirements for a bias audit?', 'answer': 'A bias audit must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category and compare the selection rates to determine an impact ratio.'}, {'question': 'What is test data in the context of a bias audit?', 'answer': 'Test data is data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.'}], 'fake_fact': None}","The relationship between the requirements for a bias audit and the concept of test data is as follows:

1. **Bias Audit Requirements**:
   - A bias audit must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category as required by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).
   - The selection rates are compared to the most selected category to determine an impact ratio.
   - The audit must be conducted by an independent auditor with no financial interest in the employer, employment agency, or vendor.
   - The results of the bias audit must be published.
   - Employers and employment agencies must provide notices to employees and candidates for employment.

2. **Test Data**:
   - Test data is used in a bias audit when there is insufficient historical data available to conduct a statistically significant audit.
   - The summary of the bias audit results must explain why historical data was not used.
   - The summary must also describe how the test data was generated and obtained.

What is the relationship between the purpose of a bias audit and when an employer can rely on a bias audit that uses test data?,"The purpose of a bias audit is to calculate the impact ratio for each category and ensure non-discriminatory impact. An employer can rely on a bias audit that uses test data when there is insufficient historical data available to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.

these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.

1. **Bias Audit**: The tool must have undergone a bias audit within the past year.
2. **Public Disclosure**: A summary of the most recent bias audit results and the distribution date of the tool must be publicly available on the employer's or employment agency's website before the tool is used.
3. **Candidate Notification**: The employer or employment agency must notify each candidate residing in the city at least ten business days before the tool is used. This notification should inform candidates that the tool will be used and allow them to request an alternative selection process or accommodation.

An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. Can the employer rely on a bias audit conducted using test data?,"No, the employer cannot rely on a bias audit conducted using test data. According to § 5-303, an employer may rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other employers or employment agencies, but not on a bias audit conducted using test data.","Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit. The vendor provides historical data regarding 
applicant selection that the vendor has collected from multiple employers to an independent auditor who 
will conduct a bias audit as follows:

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'rule_conclusion', 'seed_document_id': 11, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","Yes, an employer can rely on a bias audit conducted using test data for an AEDT if there is insufficient historical data available to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'rule_conclusion', 'seed_document_id': 13, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","Yes, an employer can rely on a bias audit that uses test data instead of historical data to assess the impact of their hiring process on different race/ethnicity categories if there is insufficient historical data available to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Using Test Data vs. Historical Data for a Bias Audit

#### Advantages of Using Test Data:
1. **Availability:** Test data can be used when there is insufficient historical data to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. This is particularly useful for employers or employment agencies using an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT) for the first time.
2. **Controlled Environment:** Test data allows for the creation of controlled scenarios to evaluate the AEDT's performance, which can help identify potential biases in a more systematic manner.

#### Disadvantages of Using Test Data:
1. **Lack of Real-World Context:** Test data may not fully capture the complexities and nuances of real-world hiring scenarios, potentially leading to less accurate assessments of the AEDT's bias.
2. **Explanation Requirement:** When using test data, the summary of results must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data was generated and obtained, adding an extra layer of documentation and justification.

#### Advantages of Using Historical Data:
1. **Real-World Relevance:** Historical data reflects actual hiring decisions and outcomes, providing a more accurate and relevant basis for assessing the AEDT's bias.
2. **Established Patterns:** Historical data can reveal established patterns of bias that may not be apparent in test data, leading to more effective mitigation strategies.

#### Disadvantages of Using Historical Data:
1. **Data Sufficiency:** There may be insufficient historical data to conduct a statistically significant bias audit, especially for new or infrequently used AEDTs.
2. **Data Sharing:** Employers or employment agencies may need to share their historical data with independent auditors, which could raise concerns about data privacy and confidentiality.

In summary, the choice between test data and historical data for a bias audit depends on the availability of sufficient historical data and the specific circumstances of the AEDT's use.",False,"The agent's answer is misleading. While it correctly mentions that test data can be used if there is insufficient historical data, it initially states that an employer can rely on test data without this important condition. The ground truth specifies that test data can only be used if there is insufficient historical data, which is a crucial distinction.",1.0,0.44,0.9771223865667478,0.8333333332916666,1.0,"The generated answer is completely incorrect as it contradicts the reference answer by stating that an employer can rely on test data for a bias audit, which is not accurate unless historical data is insufficient."

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

For the purposes of this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings:
   Automated employment decision tool. The term ""automated employment decision tool"" means any computational process, derived from machine
learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence, that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation,
that is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons. The term
""automated employment decision tool"" does not include a tool that does not automate, support, substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-
making processes and that does not materially impact natural persons, including, but not limited to, a junk email filter, firewall, antivirus software,
calculator, spreadsheet, database, data set, or other compilation of data.
   Bias audit. The term ""bias audit"" means an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor. Such bias audit shall include but not be limited to the
testing of an automated employment decision tool to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported
by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of
federal regulations.

at any point during the bias audit, has a direct financial interest or a material indirect 
financial interest in an employer or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to 
use the  AEDT or in a vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT. 
 
Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.  
 
 
 
    _________selection rate for a category________

Impact Ratio =        scoring rate of the highest scoring category 
 
 
Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;",[],"{'question_type': 'rule_conclusion', 'seed_document_id': 9, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","### Requirements for Conducting a Bias Audit of an AEDT

To conduct a bias audit of an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT) used for screening candidates based on 'culture fit,' the following requirements must be met:

1. **Calculation of Selection Rates**: 
   - The selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category must be calculated. These categories are those required to be reported to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report.

2. **Comparison of Selection Rates**: 
   - The selection rates must be compared to the most selected category to determine an impact ratio. This is consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures.

3. **Independent Auditor**: 
   - The bias audit must be conducted by an independent auditor who is not employed by or has no financial interest in the employer, employment agency, or the vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT.

4. **Historical Data**: 
   - The vendor must provide historical data regarding applicant selection that has been collected from multiple employers to the independent auditor.

5. **Frequency of Audit**: 
   - The bias audit must be conducted no more than a year before the planned use of the AEDT.

These requirements ensure that the AEDT is evaluated for potential biases in its screening process, even if it is only used at an early point in the application process and not for making final hiring decisions.

### What is an AEDT?

An AEDT, or Automated Employment Decision Tool, is a tool used in employment that relies on a simplified output, such as a score, tag, classification, or ranking, to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-making. This can involve:

- Relying solely on the output with no other factors considered.
- Using the output as a weighted criterion among others.
- Using the output to overrule conclusions derived from other factors, including human decision-making.",False,"The agent's answer includes additional details that are not part of the ground truth answer.

Document 0: Subchapter 25: Automated Employment Decision Tools
§ 20-870 Definitions.
For the purposes of this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings:
   Automated employment decision tool. The term ""automated employment decision tool"" means any computational process, derived from machine
learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence, that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation,
that is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons. The term
""automated employment decision tool"" does not include a tool that does not automate, support, substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-
making processes and that does not materially impact natural persons, including, but not limited to, a junk email filter, firewall, antivirus software,
calculator, spreadsheet, database, data set, or other compilation of data.
   Bias audit. The term ""bias audit"" means an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor. Such bias audit shall include but not be limited to the
testing of an automated employment decision tool to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported
by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of
federal regulations.
   Employment decision. The term ""employment decision"" means to screen candidates for employment or employees for promotion within the city.
(L.L. 2021/144, 12/11/2021, eff. 1/1/2023)
§ 20-871 Requirements for automated employment decision tools.
   a.   In the city, it shall be unlawful for an employer or an employment agency to use an automated employment decision tool to screen a candidate or

§ 20-873 Enforcement.
The corporation counsel or such other persons designated by the corporation counsel on behalf of the department may initiate in any court of competent
jurisdiction any action or proceeding that may be appropriate or necessary for correction of any violation issued pursuant this subchapter, including
mandating compliance with the provisions of this chapter or such other relief as may be appropriate.

1. **Bias Audit**: The tool must have undergone a bias audit within the past year.
2. **Public Disclosure**: A summary of the most recent bias audit results and the distribution date of the tool must be publicly available on the employer's website.
3. **Candidate Notification**: Employers must notify each candidate or employee residing in the city at least ten business days before using the tool. This notification should inform them that the tool will be used and allow them to request an alternative selection process or accommodation.
4. **Information on Assessment**: Employers must provide information about the job qualifications and characteristics that the tool will assess at least ten business days before its use.
5. **Data Information**: Upon written request, employers must provide information about the type of data collected, the source of the data, and the data retention policy within 30 days, unless such disclosure would violate laws or interfere with law enforcement investigations.

An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. Can the employer rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT?,"Yes, the employer can rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other employers or employment agencies.","Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

§ 20-870 Definitions.
For the purposes of this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings:
   Automated employment decision tool. The term ""automated employment decision tool"" means any computational process, derived from machine
learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence, that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation,
that is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons. The term
""automated employment decision tool"" does not include a tool that does not automate, support, substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-
making processes and that does not materially impact natural persons, including, but not limited to, a junk email filter, firewall, antivirus software,
calculator, spreadsheet, database, data set, or other compilation of data.
   Bias audit. The term ""bias audit"" means an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor. Such bias audit shall include but not be limited to the
testing of an automated employment decision tool to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported
by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of
federal regulations.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and

(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'rule_conclusion', 'seed_document_id': 15, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","To use an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT) to score applicants for 'culture fit,' the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before its use.

An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job posting. What are the requirements for a bias audit of the AEDT?,"For an AEDT that selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion, a bias audit must calculate the selection rate and impact ratio for each category, including sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories. The bias audit must also indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT that are not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category.","Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Document 6: 2 
 
 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category.

New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection 
 
Notice of Adoption of Final Rule 
 
Pursuant to the authority vested in the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection by 
Sections 1043 and 2203(f) of the New York City Charter and Section 20-104(b) of the New York City 
Administrative Code, and in accordance with the requirements of Section 1043 of the New York City Charter, 
the Department amends Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York.  
 
An initial version of this rule was proposed and published on September 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on 
November 4, 2022, and comments regarding the rule were received. DCWP proposed a second version of this 
rule on December 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on January 23, 2023, and comments regarding the rule 
were received.  
 
Statement of Basis and Purpose 
 
The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP” or “Department”) is adding rules to implement 
new legislation regarding automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”). Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits 
employers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has 
been subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly 
available, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   
 
These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.",[],"{'question_type': 'rule_conclusion', 'seed_document_id': 17, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","Yes, an employer needs to conduct a bias audit of an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT) used to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job posting.

"If an employer in New York City uses an automated employment decision tool to screen candidates or employees for an employment decision, what requirements must be met?","In New York City, it is unlawful for an employer or employment agency to use an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has been the subject of a bias audit conducted within the past year. Additionally, a summary of the most recent bias audit results and the distribution date of the tool must be made publicly available on the employer or employment agency's website prior to using the tool. The employer or employment agency must also provide notice to each employee or candidate who resides in the city, informing them that an automated employment decision tool will be used, disclosing the job qualifications and characteristics that the tool will use, and providing information about the type of data used by the tool if not already disclosed on the website.","Document 7: 3

This regulation ensures that these tools are subject to bias audits and other compliance measures to prevent discriminatory practices in employment decisions.,False,"The agent's answer is related to the regulation of automated employment decision tools in New York City, but it does not specifically address the purpose of a bias audit, which is to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported by employers.",1.0,0.75,0.80554838,0.8333333332916666,3.0,"The generated answer partially addresses the purpose of bias audits but focuses more on regulatory aspects rather than the audit's specific purpose, leading to some inaccuracies."
What calculations are required?,"The calculations required in the bias audit for the AEDT include: (1) calculating the selection rate for each category, (2) calculating the impact ratio for each category, and (3) ensuring that the calculations separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race.","Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'vague', 'seed_document_id': 15, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","The required calculations include:

1. **Median Score Calculation**: Determine the median score for the entire sample of applicants.
2. **Scoring Rate Calculation**: Calculate the scoring rate for individuals in each category.

4. **Separate Impact Analysis**:
   - **Sex Categories**: Calculate the impact ratio for the selection of male candidates versus female candidates.
   - **Race/Ethnicity Categories**: Calculate the impact ratio for the selection of candidates from different racial or ethnic backgrounds (e.g., Hispanic or Latino vs. Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino]).
   - **Intersectional Categories**: Calculate the impact ratio for the selection of candidates based on combined categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American female candidates).

What should be in the summary?,"The summary of results of a bias audit should include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios for all categories.","Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical

employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.

The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 


“Shall” and “must” denote mandatory requirements and may be used interchangeably in the rules of this 
department, unless otherwise specified or unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

What are the criteria for a bias audit?,"A bias audit of an AEDT must, at a minimum, calculate the selection rate for each category, calculate the impact ratio for each category, ensure that the calculations separately calculate the impact on sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories, and indicate the number of individuals not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category.","Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Document 6: 2 
 
 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

[Deleted material is in brackets.] 
 
“Shall” and “must” denote mandatory requirements and may be used interchangeably in the rules of this 
department, unless otherwise specified or unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.",[],"{'question_type': 'vague', 'seed_document_id': 5, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","The criteria for a bias audit include:

What are the criteria for an AEDT bias audit?,"A bias audit of an AEDT must, at a minimum, calculate the selection rate for each category, calculate the impact ratio for each category, ensure separate calculations for sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories, perform calculations for each group if applicable, and indicate the number of individuals not included in the calculations due to an unknown category.","Document 14: Data 
on those individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
(c) Where an AEDT scores candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion, a bias 
audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the median score for the full sample of applicants;  
(2) Calculate the scoring rate for individuals in each category;

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;",[],"{'question_type': 'vague', 'seed_document_id': 14, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","The criteria for an AEDT (Automated Employment Decision Tool) bias audit include:

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.

(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'vague', 'seed_document_id': 15, 'topic': 'Employment Bias Audit', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","The required calculations include:

1. **Selection Rate Calculation**: Determine the selection rate for each category.
2. **Impact Ratio Calculation**: Calculate the impact ratio for each category.
3. **Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT) Impact Analysis**:

What are the requirements for the results?,"The requirements for the published results of the bias audit include calculating the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category, comparing the selection rates to the most selected category to determine an impact ratio, and reporting these calculations to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) as required by the EEO Component 1 report.","Document 9: 4 
 
iii. 
at any point during the bias audit, has a direct financial interest or a material indirect 
financial interest in an employer or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to 
use the  AEDT or in a vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT. 
 
Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.  
 
 
 
    _________selection rate for a category________  
Impact Ratio =        selection rate of the most selected category

     ______scoring rate for a category__________  
Impact Ratio =        scoring rate of the highest scoring category 
 
 
Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;",[],"{'question_type': 'vague', 'seed_document_id': 9, 'topic': 'Employment Bias Audit', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","The requirements for the results include:

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

For the purposes of this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings:
   Automated employment decision tool. The term ""automated employment decision tool"" means any computational process, derived from machine
learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence, that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation,
that is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons. The term
""automated employment decision tool"" does not include a tool that does not automate, support, substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-
making processes and that does not materially impact natural persons, including, but not limited to, a junk email filter, firewall, antivirus software,
calculator, spreadsheet, database, data set, or other compilation of data.
   Bias audit. The term ""bias audit"" means an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor. Such bias audit shall include but not be limited to the
testing of an automated employment decision tool to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported
by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of
federal regulations.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available

What is the objective?,"The purpose of a bias audit for an AEDT is to calculate the selection rate and impact ratio for different categories, such as sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectional categories. It also ensures that the calculations are performed for each group if the AEDT classifies candidates into specified groups.","Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Document 6: 2 
 
 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.","[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'I need to know the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'How can I help you with that?'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'What are they?'}]","{'question_type': 'conversational', 'seed_document_id': 5, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","The requirements for a bias audit of an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT) are as follows:

1. **Selection Rate Calculation**: The audit must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category as required by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) EEO Component 1 report.

2. **Impact Ratio Determination**: The selection rates must be compared to the most selected category to determine an impact ratio.

3. **Independent Auditor**: The audit must be conducted by an independent auditor who does not have any employment or financial interest in the employer, employment agency, or the vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT.

4. **Timeliness**: The audit must be conducted no more than a year before the planned use of the AEDT.

5. **Publication of Results**: The results of the bias audit must be published.

The ground truth specifies the need to calculate the selection rate, impact ratio, and separately calculate the impact on sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectional categories, as well as indicate the number of individuals not included in the calculations due to unknown categories.

What is it called?,'Test data' refers to data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.,"Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum:

i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category.

agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

The purpose of a bias audit in an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT) is to ensure that the tool does not exhibit discriminatory biases in its selection process. This involves evaluating the tool to ensure fairness and equity across different demographic groups. The audit must be conducted at least once a year and is required even if the AEDT is only used for initial screening and not for making final hiring decisions.

### What a Bias Audit Calculates

A bias audit in an AEDT calculates the following:

1. **Selection Rate for Each Category**: The rate at which individuals in different categories (e.g., sex, race/ethnicity) are selected by the AEDT.
2. **Impact Ratio for Each Category**: The ratio of the selection rate for a particular category to the selection rate for the most favored category.
3. **Impact on Intersectional Categories**: The impact of the AEDT on intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race.
4. **Median Score for the Full Sample**: The median score of all applicants assessed by the AEDT.
5. **Scoring Rate for Individuals in Each Category**: The rate at which individuals in each category receive certain scores.
6. **Number of Individuals in Unknown Categories**: The number of individuals assessed by the AEDT who fall within an unknown category and are not included in the required calculations.",True,"The agent's answer provides a detailed explanation of the purpose of a bias audit in an AEDT and includes all the key elements mentioned in the ground truth, such as the selection rate, impact ratio, and the number of individuals in unknown categories.

What is the meaning of it?,'Test data' refers to data used in a bias audit that is not historical data.,"Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

§ 20-871 Requirements for automated employment decision tools.
   a.   In the city, it shall be unlawful for an employer or an employment agency to use an automated employment decision tool to screen a candidate or
employee for an employment decision unless:
      1.   Such tool has been the subject of a bias audit conducted no more than one year prior to the use of such tool; and
      2.   A summary of the results of the most recent bias audit of such tool as well as the distribution date of the tool to which such audit applies has been

This includes testing the tool to ensure it does not unfairly discriminate against certain groups.,True,"The agent's answer captures the essence of the ground truth answer, which is to assess the tool's disparate impact on certain groups. While the agent's answer is less detailed, it correctly conveys the main purpose of the bias audit.",1.0,0.75,0.8006695563156316,0.8333333332916666,4.0,"The generated answer is mostly correct, addressing the purpose of a bias audit and its focus on disparate impact, but it lacks specific legal references that enhance completeness."
What are the necessary details?,"A bias audit of an AEDT must, at a minimum, calculate the selection rate for each category, calculate the impact ratio for each category, separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories, and indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT that are not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category.","Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Document 6: 2 
 
 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

“Shall” and “must” denote mandatory requirements and may be used interchangeably in the rules of this 
department, unless otherwise specified or unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.","[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'I need to know the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'How can I help you with that?'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'What are the necessary details?'}]","{'question_type': 'conversational', 'seed_document_id': 5, 'topic': 'Bias Audit of AEDT', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","The requirements for a bias audit of an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT) include:

2. **Impact Ratio Determination**: The selection rates must be compared to the most selected category to determine an impact ratio.

3. **Independent Auditor**: The audit must be conducted by an independent auditor who does not have any employment or financial interest in the employer, employment agency, or the vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT.

4. **Timeliness**: The audit must be conducted no more than a year before the planned use of the AEDT.

5. **Publication of Results**: The results of the bias audit must be published.

What is the definition?,Bias audit means an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor. Such bias audit shall include but not be limited to the testing of an automated employment decision tool to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of federal regulations.,"Document 7: 3

Statement of Basis and Purpose 
 
The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP” or “Department”) is adding rules to implement 
new legislation regarding automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”). Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits 
employers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has 
been subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly 
available, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   
 
These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.
