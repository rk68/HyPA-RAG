A public hearing was held on \nNovember 4, 2022, and comments regarding the rule were received. DCWP proposed a second version of this \nrule on December 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on January 23, 2023, and comments regarding the rule \nwere received.  \n \nStatement of Basis and Purpose \n \nThe Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP” or “Department”) is adding rules to implement \nnew legislation regarding automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”). Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits \nemployers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has \nbeen subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly \navailable, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   \n \nThese rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and \nsex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) \npursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to \ndetermine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform \nGuidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations \nof employers and employment agencies under the new law.\n\nDocument 7: 3 \n \nSection 1.

A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical \ndata of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers \nor employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency \nmay rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment \nagencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical \ndata from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such \nemployer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. \n(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or \nemployment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available \nto conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the \nbias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was \ngenerated and obtained.  \n \nExample 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias \naudit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit \nconducted using test data.\n\nDocument 19: 9 \n \nExample 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the \nemployment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test \ndata. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 \nmonths have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data \nfrom 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias \naudit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and \nemployment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and \nconsideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. \n \nExample 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. \nThe employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may \nrely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of \nhistorical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a \nbias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other \nemployers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test \ndata.  \n \n§ 5-303 Published Results. \n(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following \npublicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  \n(1) \nThe date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall \ninclude the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of \nindividuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of \napplicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios \nfor all categories; and, \n(2) \nThe distribution date of the AEDT.\n\nDocument 11: 5 \n \n \nTest data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. \n§ 5-301 Bias Audit. \n(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has \npassed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  \n(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to \nmove forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: \n(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; \n(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; \n(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately \ncalculate the impact of the AEDT on: \ni. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  \nii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino \ncandidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and \niii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of \nHispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American \nfemale candidates). \n(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for \neach group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered \nfor promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and \n(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required \ncalculations because they fall within an unknown category. \n \nExample: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job \nposting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than \na year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not \nusing the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application \nprocess. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.\n\nDocument 17: 8 \n \n \nIntersectional Categories \n \n \n \n# of \nApplicants \nScoring \nRate \nImpact \nRatio \nHispanic or Latino \nMale \n16 \n75% \n1.00 \nFemale \n12 \n50% \n0.67 \nNon/Hispanic or \nLatino \nMale \nWhite \n20 \n35% \n0.47 \nBlack or African American \n20 \n50% \n0.67 \nNative Hawaiian or Pacific Islander \n4 \n75% \n1.00 \nAsian \n12 \n58.3% \n0.78 \nNative American or Alaska Native \n8 \n62.5 \n0.83 \nTwo or More Races \n12 \n50% \n0.67 \nFemale \nWhite \n20 \n40% \n0.53 \nBlack or African American \n12 \n50% \n.67 \nNative Hawaiian or Pacific Islander \n4 \n50% \n0.67 \nAsian \n12 \n25% \n0.33 \nNative American or Alaska Native \n8 \n62.5% \n0.83 \nTwo or More Races \n8 \n50% \n0.67 \n \nNote: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category.

Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  \nii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino \ncandidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and \niii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of \nHispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American \nfemale candidates). \n(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for \neach group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered \nfor promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and \n(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required \ncalculations because they fall within an unknown category. \n \nExample: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job \nposting.

The bias audit the \nemployment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test \ndata. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 \nmonths have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data \nfrom 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias \naudit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and \nemployment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and \nconsideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. \n \nExample 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. \nThe employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT.

The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test \ndata.  \n \n§ 5-303 Published Results. \n(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following \npublicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  \n(1) \nThe date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall \ninclude the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of \nindividuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of \napplicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios \nfor all categories; and, \n(2) \nThe distribution date of the AEDT.\n\nDocument 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical \ndata of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers \nor employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency \nmay rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment \nagencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical \ndata from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such \nemployer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. \n(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or \nemployment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available \nto conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the \nbias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was \ngenerated and obtained.  \n \nExample 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias \naudit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit \nconducted using test data.\n\nDocument 11: 5 \n \n \nTest data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. \n§ 5-301 Bias Audit. \n(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has \npassed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  \n(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to \nmove forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: \n(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; \n(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; \n(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately \ncalculate the impact of the AEDT on: \ni. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  \nii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino \ncandidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and \niii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of \nHispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American \nfemale candidates). \n(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for \neach group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered \nfor promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and \n(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required \ncalculations because they fall within an unknown category. \n \nExample: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job \nposting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than \na year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not \nusing the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application \nprocess. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.\n\nDocument 12: Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job \nposting.

Definitions. \nAs used in this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings: \n \nAutomated Employment Decision Tool. “Automated employment decision tool” or “AEDT” means \n“Automated employment decision tool” as defined by § 20-870 of the Code where the phrase “to \nsubstantially assist or replace discretionary decision making” means: \ni. \nto rely solely on a simplified output (score, tag, classification, ranking, etc.), with no other \nfactors considered; or \nii. \n to use a simplified output as one of a set of criteria where the simplified output is weighted \nmore than any other criterion in the set; or   \niii. \nto use a simplified output to overrule conclusions derived from other factors including \nhuman decision-making.  \n  \nBias Audit. “Bias audit” means “Bias audit” as defined by § 20-870 of the Code.  \n \nCandidate for Employment. “Candidate for employment” means a person who has applied for a specific \nemployment position by submitting the necessary information or items in the format required by the \nemployer or employment agency.  \n \nCategory. “Category” means any component 1 category required to be reported by employers pursuant \nto subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States Code as specified in part 1602.7 of \ntitle 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, as designated on the Equal Employment Opportunity \nCommission Employer Information Report EEO-1. \n \nCode. “Code” means the Administrative Code of the City of New York. \n \nDistribution Date. “Distribution date” means the date the employer or employment agency began using \na specific AEDT.  \n \nEmployment Decision. “Employment decision” means “Employment decision” as defined by § 20-870 \nof the Code. \n \nEmployment Agency. “Employment agency” means “Employment agency” as defined by 6 RCNY § 5-\n249.  \n \nHistorical data.", "conversation_history": [], "metadata": {"question_type": "simple", "seed_document_id": 0, "topic": "Automated Employment Decision Tools (AEDTs)", "distracting_context": null, "situational_context": null, "original_questions": null, "fake_fact": null}}

It must also indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT that fall within an unknown category.", "reference_context": "Document 19: 9 \n \nExample 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the \nemployment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test \ndata. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 \nmonths have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data \nfrom 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias \naudit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and \nemployment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and \nconsideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. \n \nExample 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. \nThe employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may \nrely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of \nhistorical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a \nbias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other \nemployers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test \ndata.  \n \n§ 5-303 Published Results. \n(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following \npublicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  \n(1) \nThe date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall \ninclude the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of \nindividuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of \napplicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios \nfor all categories; and, \n(2) \nThe distribution date of the AEDT.\n\nDocument 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical \ndata of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers \nor employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency \nmay rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment \nagencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical \ndata from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such \nemployer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. \n(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or \nemployment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available \nto conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the \nbias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was \ngenerated and obtained.  \n \nExample 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias \naudit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit \nconducted using test data.\n\nDocument 11: 5 \n \n \nTest data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. \n§ 5-301 Bias Audit. \n(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has \npassed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  \n(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to \nmove forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: \n(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; \n(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; \n(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately \ncalculate the impact of the AEDT on: \ni. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  \nii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino \ncandidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and \niii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of \nHispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American \nfemale candidates). \n(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for \neach group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered \nfor promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and \n(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required \ncalculations because they fall within an unknown category. \n \nExample: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job \nposting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than \na year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not \nusing the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application \nprocess. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.\n\nDocument 12: Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job \nposting.

The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers \nor employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency \nmay rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment \nagencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical \ndata from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such \nemployer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. \n(b) Test Data.

Such rate may be calculated \nby dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the \ntotal number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  \n \nExample.\n\nDocument 15: 7 \n \n(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  \n(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision \nseparately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: \ni. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  \nii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino \ncandidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and \niii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of \nHispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American \nfemale candidates); and  \n(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required \ncalculations because they fall within an unknown category. \n(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and \n(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of \nthe data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a \ncategory is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the \nexclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded \ncategory.  \n \nExample: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must \nensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.\n\nDocument 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above \nthe sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. \n \nScreen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or \nemployee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion \nprocess.  \n \nSelection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to \nmove forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated \nby dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the \ntotal number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  \n \nExample. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an \nAEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  \n \nSimplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition \nfor “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output \nmay take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization \n(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), \nrecommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a \nlist of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the \noutput from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF \nor transcribe a video or audio interview.\n\nDocument 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and \nsex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) \npursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to \ndetermine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform \nGuidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations \nof employers and employment agencies under the new law. \n \nSpecifically, these new rules will: \n \nDefine terms; \n \nClarify the requirements for a bias audit;  \n \nClarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  \n \nClarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees \nand candidates for employment; and  \n \nClarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  \n \nThe Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received \ncomments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and \nadvocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, \npublished in December 2022. Those changes included:  \n \nModifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; \n \nClarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer \nor employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or \ndistributed the AEDT; \n \nRevising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;", "conversation_history": [], "metadata": {"question_type": "simple", "seed_document_id": 9, "topic": "Bias Audits", "distracting_context": null, "situational_context": null, "original_questions": null, "fake_fact": null}}

This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not \nusing the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application \nprocess. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit. The vendor provides historical data regarding \napplicant selection that the vendor has collected from multiple employers to an independent auditor who \nwill conduct a bias audit as follows:  \n \nSex Categories \n  \n# of \nApplicants \n# \nSelected \nSelection \nRate \nImpact Ratio \nMale \n1390 \n667 \n48% \n1.00 \nFemale \n1181 \n555 \n47% \n0.979\n\nDocument 19: 9 \n \nExample 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the \nemployment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test \ndata. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 \nmonths have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data \nfrom 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias \naudit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and \nemployment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and \nconsideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. \n \nExample 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. \nThe employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may \nrely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of \nhistorical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a \nbias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other \nemployers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test \ndata.  \n \n§ 5-303 Published Results. \n(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following \npublicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  \n(1) \nThe date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall \ninclude the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of \nindividuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of \napplicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios \nfor all categories; and, \n(2) \nThe distribution date of the AEDT.\n\nDocument 17: 8 \n \n \nIntersectional Categories \n \n \n \n# of \nApplicants \nScoring \nRate \nImpact \nRatio \nHispanic or Latino \nMale \n16 \n75% \n1.00 \nFemale \n12 \n50% \n0.67 \nNon/Hispanic or \nLatino \nMale \nWhite \n20 \n35% \n0.47 \nBlack or African American \n20 \n50% \n0.67 \nNative Hawaiian or Pacific Islander \n4 \n75% \n1.00 \nAsian \n12 \n58.3% \n0.78 \nNative American or Alaska Native \n8 \n62.5 \n0.83 \nTwo or More Races \n12 \n50% \n0.67 \nFemale \nWhite \n20 \n40% \n0.53 \nBlack or African American \n12 \n50% \n.67 \nNative Hawaiian or Pacific Islander \n4 \n50% \n0.67 \nAsian \n12 \n25% \n0.33 \nNative American or Alaska Native \n8 \n62.5% \n0.83 \nTwo or More Races \n8 \n50% \n0.67 \n \nNote: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category.

Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits \nemployers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has \nbeen subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly \navailable, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   \n \nThese rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and \nsex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) \npursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to \ndetermine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform \nGuidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4.

A public hearing was held on \nNovember 4, 2022, and comments regarding the rule were received. DCWP proposed a second version of this \nrule on December 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on January 23, 2023, and comments regarding the rule \nwere received.  \n \nStatement of Basis and Purpose \n \nThe Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP” or “Department”) is adding rules to implement \nnew legislation regarding automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”). Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits \nemployers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has \nbeen subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly \navailable, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   \n \nThese rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and \nsex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) \npursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to \ndetermine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform \nGuidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations \nof employers and employment agencies under the new law.\n\nDocument 7: 3 \n \nSection 1.  Chapter 5 of Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York is amended to add Subchapter T to read \nas follows: \nSubchapter T: Automated Employment Decision Tools \n§ 5-300. Definitions. \nAs used in this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings: \n \nAutomated Employment Decision Tool. “Automated employment decision tool” or “AEDT” means \n“Automated employment decision tool” as defined by § 20-870 of the Code where the phrase “to \nsubstantially assist or replace discretionary decision making” means: \ni. \nto rely solely on a simplified output (score, tag, classification, ranking, etc.), with no other \nfactors considered; or \nii. \n to use a simplified output as one of a set of criteria where the simplified output is weighted \nmore than any other criterion in the set; or   \niii. \nto use a simplified output to overrule conclusions derived from other factors including \nhuman decision-making.  \n  \nBias Audit. “Bias audit” means “Bias audit” as defined by § 20-870 of the Code.  \n \nCandidate for Employment. “Candidate for employment” means a person who has applied for a specific \nemployment position by submitting the necessary information or items in the format required by the \nemployer or employment agency.  \n \nCategory. “Category” means any component 1 category required to be reported by employers pursuant \nto subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States Code as specified in part 1602.7 of \ntitle 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, as designated on the Equal Employment Opportunity \nCommission Employer Information Report EEO-1. \n \nCode. “Code” means the Administrative Code of the City of New York. \n \nDistribution Date. “Distribution date” means the date the employer or employment agency began using \na specific AEDT.  \n \nEmployment Decision. “Employment decision” means “Employment decision” as defined by § 20-870 \nof the Code. \n \nEmployment Agency. “Employment agency” means “Employment agency” as defined by 6 RCNY § 5-\n249.  \n \nHistorical data.", "conversation_history": [], "metadata": {"question_type": "complex", "seed_document_id": 4, "topic": "Definitions and Terminology", "distracting_context": null, "situational_context": null, "original_questions": null, "fake_fact": null}}

A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical \ndata of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers \nor employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency \nmay rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment \nagencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical \ndata from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such \nemployer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. \n(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or \nemployment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available \nto conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the \nbias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was \ngenerated and obtained.  \n \nExample 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias \naudit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit \nconducted using test data.\n\nDocument 19: 9 \n \nExample 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the \nemployment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test \ndata. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 \nmonths have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data \nfrom 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias \naudit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and \nemployment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and \nconsideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. \n \nExample 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. \nThe employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may \nrely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of \nhistorical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a \nbias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other \nemployers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test \ndata.  \n \n§ 5-303 Published Results. \n(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following \npublicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  \n(1) \nThe date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall \ninclude the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of \nindividuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of \napplicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios \nfor all categories; and, \n(2) \nThe distribution date of the AEDT.\n\nDocument 11: 5 \n \n \nTest data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. \n§ 5-301 Bias Audit. \n(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has \npassed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  \n(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to \nmove forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: \n(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; \n(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; \n(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately \ncalculate the impact of the AEDT on: \ni. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  \nii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino \ncandidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and \niii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of \nHispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American \nfemale candidates). \n(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for \neach group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered \nfor promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and \n(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required \ncalculations because they fall within an unknown category. \n \nExample: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job \nposting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than \na year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not \nusing the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application \nprocess.

If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an \nAEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  \n \nSimplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition \nfor “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output \nmay take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization \n(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), \nrecommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a \nlist of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the \noutput from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF \nor transcribe a video or audio interview.\n\nDocument 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and \nsex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) \npursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to \ndetermine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform \nGuidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4.

The Department received \ncomments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and \nadvocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, \npublished in December 2022. Those changes included:  \n \nModifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; \n \nClarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer \nor employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or \ndistributed the AEDT; \n \nRevising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;", "conversation_history": [], "metadata": {"question_type": "complex", "seed_document_id": 9, "topic": "Automated Employment Decision Tools (AEDTs)", "distracting_context": null, "situational_context": null, "original_questions": null, "fake_fact": null}}

Such rate may be calculated \nby dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the \ntotal number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  \n \nExample.\n\nDocument 15: 7 \n \n(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  \n(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision \nseparately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: \ni. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  \nii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino \ncandidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and \niii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of \nHispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American \nfemale candidates); and  \n(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required \ncalculations because they fall within an unknown category. \n(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and \n(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of \nthe data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a \ncategory is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the \nexclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded \ncategory.  \n \nExample: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must \nensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.\n\nDocument 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above \nthe sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. \n \nScreen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or \nemployee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion \nprocess.  \n \nSelection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to \nmove forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated \nby dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the \ntotal number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  \n \nExample. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an \nAEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  \n \nSimplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition \nfor “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output \nmay take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization \n(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), \nrecommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a \nlist of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the \noutput from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF \nor transcribe a video or audio interview.\n\nDocument 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and \nsex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) \npursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to \ndetermine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform \nGuidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations \nof employers and employment agencies under the new law. \n \nSpecifically, these new rules will: \n \nDefine terms; \n \nClarify the requirements for a bias audit;  \n \nClarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  \n \nClarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees \nand candidates for employment; and  \n \nClarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  \n \nThe Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received \ncomments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and \nadvocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, \npublished in December 2022. Those changes included:  \n \nModifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; \n \nClarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer \nor employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or \ndistributed the AEDT; \n \nRevising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;", "conversation_history": [], "metadata": {"question_type": "distracting element", "seed_document_id": 9, "topic": "Bias Audits", "distracting_context": "4 \n \niii. \nat any point during the bias audit, has a direct financial interest or a material indirect \nfinancial interest in an employer or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to \nuse the  AEDT or in a vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT. \n \nImpact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection \nrate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the \nhighest scoring category.  \n \n \n \n    _________selection rate for a category________  \nImpact Ratio =        selection rate of the most selected category  \n \nOR \n \n  \n \n     ______scoring rate for a category__________  \nImpact Ratio =        scoring rate of the highest scoring category \n \n \nMachine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, \nstatistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-\nbased techniques:  \ni. \nthat generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an \nassessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, \nmeaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on \nskill sets or aptitude; and  \nii. \nfor which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed \non those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve \nthe accuracy of the prediction or classification. \n \nScoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above \nthe sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. \n \nScreen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or \nemployee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion \nprocess.  \n \nSelection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to \nmove forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT.

The term \"automated employment decision tool\" means any computational process, derived from machine\nlearning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence, that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation,\nthat is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons. The term\n\"automated employment decision tool\" does not include a tool that does not automate, support, substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-\nmaking processes and that does not materially impact natural persons, including, but not limited to, a junk email filter, firewall, antivirus software,\ncalculator, spreadsheet, database, data set, or other compilation of data.\n   Bias audit. The term \"bias audit\" means an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor. Such bias audit shall include but not be limited to the\ntesting of an automated employment decision tool to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported\nby employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of\nfederal regulations.\n   Employment decision. The term \"employment decision\" means to screen candidates for employment or employees for promotion within the city.\n(L.L. 2021/144, 12/11/2021, eff. 1/1/2023)\n§ 20-871 Requirements for automated employment decision tools.\n   a.   In the city, it shall be unlawful for an employer or an employment agency to use an automated employment decision tool to screen a candidate or\nemployee for an employment decision unless:\n      1.   Such tool has been the subject of a bias audit conducted no more than one year prior to the use of such tool; and\n      2.   A summary of the results of the most recent bias audit of such tool as well as the distribution date of the tool to which such audit applies has been\nmade publicly available on the website of the employer or employment agency prior to the use of such tool.\n   b.

The Department received \ncomments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and \nadvocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, \npublished in December 2022. Those changes included:  \n \nModifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; \n \nClarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer \nor employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or \ndistributed the AEDT; \n \nRevising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;", "conversation_history": [], "metadata": {"question_type": "distracting element", "seed_document_id": 9, "topic": "Bias Audits", "distracting_context": "9 \n \nExample 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months.

The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 \nmonths have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data \nfrom 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias \naudit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and \nemployment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and \nconsideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. \n \nExample 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. \nThe employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT.

A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical \ndata of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers \nor employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency \nmay rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment \nagencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical \ndata from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such \nemployer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. \n(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or \nemployment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available \nto conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the \nbias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was \ngenerated and obtained.  \n \nExample 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias \naudit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit \nconducted using test data.\n\nDocument 19: 9 \n \nExample 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the \nemployment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test \ndata. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 \nmonths have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data \nfrom 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias \naudit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and \nemployment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and \nconsideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. \n \nExample 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. \nThe employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT.

Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  \nii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino \ncandidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and \niii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of \nHispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American \nfemale candidates). \n(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for \neach group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered \nfor promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and \n(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required \ncalculations because they fall within an unknown category. \n \nExample: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job \nposting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than \na year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not \nusing the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application \nprocess. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.\n\nDocument 17: 8 \n \n \nIntersectional Categories \n \n \n \n# of \nApplicants \nScoring \nRate \nImpact \nRatio \nHispanic or Latino \nMale \n16 \n75% \n1.00 \nFemale \n12 \n50% \n0.67 \nNon/Hispanic or \nLatino \nMale \nWhite \n20 \n35% \n0.47 \nBlack or African American \n20 \n50% \n0.67 \nNative Hawaiian or Pacific Islander \n4 \n75% \n1.00 \nAsian \n12 \n58.3% \n0.78 \nNative American or Alaska Native \n8 \n62.5 \n0.83 \nTwo or More Races \n12 \n50% \n0.67 \nFemale \nWhite \n20 \n40% \n0.53 \nBlack or African American \n12 \n50% \n.67 \nNative Hawaiian or Pacific Islander \n4 \n50% \n0.67 \nAsian \n12 \n25% \n0.33 \nNative American or Alaska Native \n8 \n62.5% \n0.83 \nTwo or More Races \n8 \n50% \n0.67 \n \nNote: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category.

Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  \nii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino \ncandidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and \niii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of \nHispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American \nfemale candidates). \n(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for \neach group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered \nfor promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and \n(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required \ncalculations because they fall within an unknown category. \n \nExample: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job \nposting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than \na year before the planned use of the AEDT.

Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits \nemployers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has \nbeen subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly \navailable, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   \n \nThese rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and \nsex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) \npursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to \ndetermine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform \nGuidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations \nof employers and employment agencies under the new law.\n\nDocument 7: 3 \n \nSection 1.

Where such a \ncategory is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the \nexclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded \ncategory.  \n \nExample: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must \nensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.\n\nDocument 11: 5 \n \n \nTest data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. \n§ 5-301 Bias Audit. \n(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has \npassed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  \n(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to \nmove forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: \n(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; \n(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; \n(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately \ncalculate the impact of the AEDT on: \ni. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  \nii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino \ncandidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and \niii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of \nHispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American \nfemale candidates). \n(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for \neach group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered \nfor promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and \n(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required \ncalculations because they fall within an unknown category. \n \nExample: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job \nposting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than \na year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not \nusing the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application \nprocess.

These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform \nGuidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4.

The Department received \ncomments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and \nadvocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, \npublished in December 2022. Those changes included:  \n \nModifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; \n \nClarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer \nor employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or \ndistributed the AEDT; \n \nRevising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;", "conversation_history": [], "metadata": {"question_type": "double", "seed_document_id": 14, "topic": "Bias Audits", "distracting_context": null, "situational_context": null, "original_questions": [{"question": "What are the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT?", "answer": "An employer or employment agency must calculate the selection rate for each category and the impact ratio for each category."}, {"question": "What changes were made in the second version of the proposed rules?", "answer": "The changes included modifying the definition of AEDT and clarifying the requirements for an independent auditor."}], "fake_fact": null}}

Test data is the data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.", "reference_context": "Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and \nsex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) \npursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to \ndetermine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform \nGuidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations \nof employers and employment agencies under the new law. \n \nSpecifically, these new rules will: \n \nDefine terms; \n \nClarify the requirements for a bias audit;  \n \nClarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  \n \nClarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees \nand candidates for employment; and  \n \nClarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  \n \nThe Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received \ncomments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and \nadvocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, \npublished in December 2022. Those changes included:  \n \nModifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; \n \nClarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer \nor employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or \ndistributed the AEDT; \n \nRevising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;\n\nDocument 6: 2 \n \n \nClarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, \nrace/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; \n \nClarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; \n \nClarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they \nprovide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and \n \nClarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; \n \nThe Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including \nfrom employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various \nissues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: \n \nModifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” \nto expand its scope; \n \nAdding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are \nnot included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number \nbe included in the summary of results; \n \nAllowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being \nused for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; \n \nClarifying the examples of a bias audit; \n \nClarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the \nhistorical data of other employers or employment agencies; \n \nProviding examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with \nhistorical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; \n \nClarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must \nbe included in the summary of results. \n \nNew material is underlined. \n[Deleted material is in brackets.] \n \n“Shall” and “must” denote mandatory requirements and may be used interchangeably in the rules of this \ndepartment, unless otherwise specified or unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.\n\nDocument 11: 5 \n \n \nTest data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. \n§ 5-301 Bias Audit. \n(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has \npassed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  \n(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to \nmove forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: \n(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; \n(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; \n(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately \ncalculate the impact of the AEDT on: \ni. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  \nii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino \ncandidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and \niii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of \nHispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American \nfemale candidates). \n(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for \neach group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered \nfor promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and \n(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required \ncalculations because they fall within an unknown category. \n \nExample: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job \nposting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than \na year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not \nusing the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application \nprocess. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.\n\nDocument 15: 7 \n \n(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  \n(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision \nseparately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: \ni. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  \nii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino \ncandidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and \niii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of \nHispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American \nfemale candidates); and  \n(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required \ncalculations because they fall within an unknown category. \n(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and \n(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of \nthe data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a \ncategory is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the \nexclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded \ncategory.  \n \nExample: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must \nensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.", "conversation_history": [], "metadata": {"question_type": "double", "seed_document_id": 5, "topic": "Bias Audits", "distracting_context": null, "situational_context": null, "original_questions": [{"question": "What are the requirements for a bias audit?", "answer": "A bias audit must calculate the selection rate for each category and the impact ratio for each category."}, {"question": "What is test data?", "answer": "Test data is data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data."}], "fake_fact": null}}

These rules generally clarify obligations \nof employers and employment agencies under the new law. \n \nSpecifically, these new rules will: \n \nDefine terms; \n \nClarify the requirements for a bias audit;  \n \nClarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  \n \nClarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees \nand candidates for employment; and  \n \nClarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  \n \nThe Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received \ncomments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and \nadvocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, \npublished in December 2022. Those changes included:  \n \nModifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; \n \nClarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer \nor employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or \ndistributed the AEDT; \n \nRevising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;\n\nDocument 11: 5 \n \n \nTest data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. \n§ 5-301 Bias Audit. \n(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has \npassed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  \n(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to \nmove forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: \n(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; \n(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; \n(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately \ncalculate the impact of the AEDT on: \ni. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  \nii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino \ncandidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and \niii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of \nHispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American \nfemale candidates). \n(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for \neach group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered \nfor promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and \n(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required \ncalculations because they fall within an unknown category. \n \nExample: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job \nposting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than \na year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not \nusing the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application \nprocess. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.\n\nDocument 15: 7 \n \n(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  \n(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision \nseparately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: \ni.

The term \"automated employment decision tool\" means any computational process, derived from machine\nlearning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence, that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation,\nthat is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons. The term\n\"automated employment decision tool\" does not include a tool that does not automate, support, substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-\nmaking processes and that does not materially impact natural persons, including, but not limited to, a junk email filter, firewall, antivirus software,\ncalculator, spreadsheet, database, data set, or other compilation of data.\n   Bias audit. The term \"bias audit\" means an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor. Such bias audit shall include but not be limited to the\ntesting of an automated employment decision tool to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported\nby employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of\nfederal regulations.\n   Employment decision. The term \"employment decision\" means to screen candidates for employment or employees for promotion within the city.\n(L.L. 2021/144, 12/11/2021, eff. 1/1/2023)\n§ 20-871 Requirements for automated employment decision tools.\n   a.   In the city, it shall be unlawful for an employer or an employment agency to use an automated employment decision tool to screen a candidate or\nemployee for an employment decision unless:\n      1.   Such tool has been the subject of a bias audit conducted no more than one year prior to the use of such tool; and\n      2.   A summary of the results of the most recent bias audit of such tool as well as the distribution date of the tool to which such audit applies has been\nmade publicly available on the website of the employer or employment agency prior to the use of such tool.\n   b.

A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical \ndata of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers \nor employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency \nmay rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment \nagencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical \ndata from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such \nemployer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. \n(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or \nemployment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available \nto conduct a statistically significant bias audit.\n\nDocument 11: 5 \n \n \nTest data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. \n§ 5-301 Bias Audit. \n(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has \npassed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  \n(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to \nmove forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: \n(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; \n(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; \n(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately \ncalculate the impact of the AEDT on: \ni. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  \nii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino \ncandidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and \niii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of \nHispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American \nfemale candidates). \n(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for \neach group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered \nfor promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and \n(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required \ncalculations because they fall within an unknown category. \n \nExample: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job \nposting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than \na year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not \nusing the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application \nprocess. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.\n\nDocument 15: 7 \n \n(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  \n(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision \nseparately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: \ni. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  \nii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino \ncandidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and \niii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of \nHispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American \nfemale candidates); and  \n(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required \ncalculations because they fall within an unknown category. \n(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and \n(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of \nthe data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a \ncategory is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the \nexclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded \ncategory.  \n \nExample: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must \nensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.\n\nDocument 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical \ndata of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers \nor employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency \nmay rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment \nagencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical \ndata from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such \nemployer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. \n(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or \nemployment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available \nto conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the \nbias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was \ngenerated and obtained.  \n \nExample 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time.

The bias audit the \nemployment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test \ndata. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 \nmonths have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data \nfrom 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias \naudit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and \nemployment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and \nconsideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. \n \nExample 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. \nThe employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may \nrely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of \nhistorical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a \nbias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other \nemployers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test \ndata.  \n \n§ 5-303 Published Results. \n(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following \npublicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  \n(1) \nThe date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall \ninclude the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of \nindividuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of \napplicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios \nfor all categories; and, \n(2) \nThe distribution date of the AEDT.\n\nDocument 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and \nsex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) \npursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to \ndetermine an impact ratio.

The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit. The vendor provides historical data regarding \napplicant selection that the vendor has collected from multiple employers to an independent auditor who \nwill conduct a bias audit as follows:  \n \nSex Categories \n  \n# of \nApplicants \n# \nSelected \nSelection \nRate \nImpact Ratio \nMale \n1390 \n667 \n48% \n1.00 \nFemale \n1181 \n555 \n47% \n0.979\n\nDocument 11: 5 \n \n \nTest data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. \n§ 5-301 Bias Audit. \n(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has \npassed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  \n(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to \nmove forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: \n(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; \n(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; \n(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately \ncalculate the impact of the AEDT on: \ni. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  \nii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino \ncandidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and \niii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of \nHispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American \nfemale candidates). \n(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for \neach group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered \nfor promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and \n(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required \ncalculations because they fall within an unknown category. \n \nExample: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job \nposting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than \na year before the planned use of the AEDT.

The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 \nmonths have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data \nfrom 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias \naudit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and \nemployment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and \nconsideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. \n \nExample 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. \nThe employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may \nrely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of \nhistorical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a \nbias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other \nemployers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test \ndata.  \n \n§ 5-303 Published Results. \n(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following \npublicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  \n(1) \nThe date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall \ninclude the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of \nindividuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of \napplicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios \nfor all categories; and, \n(2) \nThe distribution date of the AEDT.\n\nDocument 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and \nsex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) \npursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to \ndetermine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform \nGuidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations \nof employers and employment agencies under the new law. \n \nSpecifically, these new rules will: \n \nDefine terms; \n \nClarify the requirements for a bias audit;  \n \nClarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  \n \nClarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees \nand candidates for employment; and  \n \nClarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  \n \nThe Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received \ncomments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and \nadvocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, \npublished in December 2022. Those changes included:  \n \nModifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; \n \nClarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer \nor employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or \ndistributed the AEDT; \n \nRevising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;", "conversation_history": [], "metadata": {"question_type": "out of scope", "seed_document_id": 12, "topic": "Bias Audits", "distracting_context": null, "situational_context": null, "original_questions": null, "fake_fact": "The vendor provides historical data for the past 10 years."}}

Such rate may be calculated \nby dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the \ntotal number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  \n \nExample. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an \nAEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  \n \nSimplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition \nfor “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output \nmay take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization \n(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), \nrecommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a \nlist of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description).

This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not \nusing the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application \nprocess. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit. The vendor provides historical data regarding \napplicant selection that the vendor has collected from multiple employers to an independent auditor who \nwill conduct a bias audit as follows:  \n \nSex Categories \n  \n# of \nApplicants \n# \nSelected \nSelection \nRate \nImpact Ratio \nMale \n1390 \n667 \n48% \n1.00 \nFemale \n1181 \n555 \n47% \n0.979\n\nDocument 11: 5 \n \n \nTest data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. \n§ 5-301 Bias Audit. \n(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has \npassed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  \n(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to \nmove forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: \n(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; \n(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; \n(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately \ncalculate the impact of the AEDT on: \ni. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  \nii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino \ncandidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and \niii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of \nHispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American \nfemale candidates). \n(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for \neach group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered \nfor promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and \n(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required \ncalculations because they fall within an unknown category. \n \nExample: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job \nposting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than \na year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not \nusing the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application \nprocess. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.\n\nDocument 19: 9 \n \nExample 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the \nemployment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test \ndata. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 \nmonths have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data \nfrom 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias \naudit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and \nemployment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and \nconsideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. \n \nExample 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. \nThe employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may \nrely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of \nhistorical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a \nbias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other \nemployers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test \ndata.  \n \n§ 5-303 Published Results. \n(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following \npublicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  \n(1) \nThe date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall \ninclude the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of \nindividuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of \napplicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios \nfor all categories; and, \n(2) \nThe distribution date of the AEDT.\n\nDocument 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and \nsex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) \npursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to \ndetermine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform \nGuidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations \nof employers and employment agencies under the new law. \n \nSpecifically, these new rules will: \n \nDefine terms; \n \nClarify the requirements for a bias audit;  \n \nClarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  \n \nClarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees \nand candidates for employment; and  \n \nClarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  \n \nThe Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received \ncomments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and \nadvocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, \npublished in December 2022. Those changes included:  \n \nModifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; \n \nClarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer \nor employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or \ndistributed the AEDT; \n \nRevising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;", "conversation_history": [], "metadata": {"question_type": "out of scope", "seed_document_id": 12, "topic": "Bias Audits", "distracting_context": null, "situational_context": null, "original_questions": null, "fake_fact": "The impact ratio for female applicants is 0.950."}}

If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the \nbias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was \ngenerated and obtained.  \n \nExample 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias \naudit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit \nconducted using test data.\n\nDocument 19: 9 \n \nExample 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the \nemployment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test \ndata. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 \nmonths have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data \nfrom 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias \naudit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and \nemployment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and \nconsideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. \n \nExample 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. \nThe employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may \nrely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of \nhistorical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a \nbias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other \nemployers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test \ndata.  \n \n§ 5-303 Published Results. \n(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following \npublicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  \n(1) \nThe date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall \ninclude the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of \nindividuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of \napplicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios \nfor all categories; and, \n(2) \nThe distribution date of the AEDT.\n\nDocument 11: 5 \n \n \nTest data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. \n§ 5-301 Bias Audit. \n(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has \npassed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  \n(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to \nmove forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: \n(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; \n(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; \n(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately \ncalculate the impact of the AEDT on: \ni. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  \nii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino \ncandidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and \niii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of \nHispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American \nfemale candidates). \n(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for \neach group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered \nfor promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and \n(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required \ncalculations because they fall within an unknown category. \n \nExample: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job \nposting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than \na year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not \nusing the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application \nprocess. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.\n\nDocument 17: 8 \n \n \nIntersectional Categories \n \n \n \n# of \nApplicants \nScoring \nRate \nImpact \nRatio \nHispanic or Latino \nMale \n16 \n75% \n1.00 \nFemale \n12 \n50% \n0.67 \nNon/Hispanic or \nLatino \nMale \nWhite \n20 \n35% \n0.47 \nBlack or African American \n20 \n50% \n0.67 \nNative Hawaiian or Pacific Islander \n4 \n75% \n1.00 \nAsian \n12 \n58.3% \n0.78 \nNative American or Alaska Native \n8 \n62.5 \n0.83 \nTwo or More Races \n12 \n50% \n0.67 \nFemale \nWhite \n20 \n40% \n0.53 \nBlack or African American \n12 \n50% \n.67 \nNative Hawaiian or Pacific Islander \n4 \n50% \n0.67 \nAsian \n12 \n25% \n0.33 \nNative American or Alaska Native \n8 \n62.5% \n0.83 \nTwo or More Races \n8 \n50% \n0.67 \n \nNote: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category.

These rules generally clarify obligations \nof employers and employment agencies under the new law. \n \nSpecifically, these new rules will: \n \nDefine terms; \n \nClarify the requirements for a bias audit;  \n \nClarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  \n \nClarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees \nand candidates for employment; and  \n \nClarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  \n \nThe Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received \ncomments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and \nadvocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, \npublished in December 2022. Those changes included:  \n \nModifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; \n \nClarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer \nor employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or \ndistributed the AEDT; \n \nRevising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;", "conversation_history": [], "metadata": {"question_type": "compare", "seed_document_id": 14, "topic": "Bias Audits", "distracting_context": null, "situational_context": null, "original_questions": [{"question": "What must be calculated in a bias audit of an AEDT?", "answer": "A bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category and compare the selection rates to determine an impact ratio."}, {"question": "What are the requirements for the published results of a bias audit?", "answer": "The requirements for the published results of a bias audit include providing notices to employees and candidates for employment and clarifying other obligations for the employer or employment agency."}], "fake_fact": null}}

In summary, the requirements for a bias audit rely on analyzing selection rates, while test data is the specific type of data used to perform the audit.", "reference_context": "Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and \nsex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) \npursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to \ndetermine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform \nGuidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations \nof employers and employment agencies under the new law. \n \nSpecifically, these new rules will: \n \nDefine terms; \n \nClarify the requirements for a bias audit;  \n \nClarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  \n \nClarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees \nand candidates for employment; and  \n \nClarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  \n \nThe Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received \ncomments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and \nadvocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, \npublished in December 2022. Those changes included:  \n \nModifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; \n \nClarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer \nor employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or \ndistributed the AEDT; \n \nRevising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;\n\nDocument 6: 2 \n \n \nClarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, \nrace/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; \n \nClarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; \n \nClarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they \nprovide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and \n \nClarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; \n \nThe Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including \nfrom employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various \nissues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: \n \nModifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” \nto expand its scope; \n \nAdding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are \nnot included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number \nbe included in the summary of results; \n \nAllowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being \nused for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; \n \nClarifying the examples of a bias audit; \n \nClarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the \nhistorical data of other employers or employment agencies; \n \nProviding examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with \nhistorical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; \n \nClarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must \nbe included in the summary of results. \n \nNew material is underlined. \n[Deleted material is in brackets.] \n \n“Shall” and “must” denote mandatory requirements and may be used interchangeably in the rules of this \ndepartment, unless otherwise specified or unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.\n\nDocument 11: 5 \n \n \nTest data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. \n§ 5-301 Bias Audit. \n(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has \npassed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  \n(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to \nmove forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: \n(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; \n(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; \n(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately \ncalculate the impact of the AEDT on: \ni.

Definitions. \nAs used in this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings: \n \nAutomated Employment Decision Tool. “Automated employment decision tool” or “AEDT” means \n“Automated employment decision tool” as defined by § 20-870 of the Code where the phrase “to \nsubstantially assist or replace discretionary decision making” means: \ni. \nto rely solely on a simplified output (score, tag, classification, ranking, etc.), with no other \nfactors considered; or \nii. \n to use a simplified output as one of a set of criteria where the simplified output is weighted \nmore than any other criterion in the set; or   \niii. \nto use a simplified output to overrule conclusions derived from other factors including \nhuman decision-making.  \n  \nBias Audit. “Bias audit” means “Bias audit” as defined by § 20-870 of the Code.  \n \nCandidate for Employment. “Candidate for employment” means a person who has applied for a specific \nemployment position by submitting the necessary information or items in the format required by the \nemployer or employment agency.  \n \nCategory. “Category” means any component 1 category required to be reported by employers pursuant \nto subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States Code as specified in part 1602.7 of \ntitle 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, as designated on the Equal Employment Opportunity \nCommission Employer Information Report EEO-1. \n \nCode. “Code” means the Administrative Code of the City of New York. \n \nDistribution Date. “Distribution date” means the date the employer or employment agency began using \na specific AEDT.  \n \nEmployment Decision. “Employment decision” means “Employment decision” as defined by § 20-870 \nof the Code. \n \nEmployment Agency. “Employment agency” means “Employment agency” as defined by 6 RCNY § 5-\n249.  \n \nHistorical data.", "conversation_history": [], "metadata": {"question_type": "rule_conclusion", "seed_document_id": 0, "topic": "Automated Employment Decision Tools (AEDTs)", "distracting_context": null, "situational_context": null, "original_questions": null, "fake_fact": null}}

Can the employer rely on a bias audit conducted using test data?", "reference_answer": "No, the employer cannot rely on a bias audit conducted using test data. According to § 5-303, an employer may rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other employers or employment agencies, but not on a bias audit conducted using test data.", "reference_context": "Document 11: 5 \n \n \nTest data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. \n§ 5-301 Bias Audit. \n(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has \npassed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  \n(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to \nmove forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: \n(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; \n(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; \n(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately \ncalculate the impact of the AEDT on: \ni. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  \nii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino \ncandidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and \niii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of \nHispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American \nfemale candidates). \n(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for \neach group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered \nfor promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and \n(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required \ncalculations because they fall within an unknown category. \n \nExample: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job \nposting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than \na year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not \nusing the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application \nprocess. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.\n\nDocument 12: Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job \nposting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than \na year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not \nusing the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application \nprocess. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit. The vendor provides historical data regarding \napplicant selection that the vendor has collected from multiple employers to an independent auditor who \nwill conduct a bias audit as follows:  \n \nSex Categories \n  \n# of \nApplicants \n# \nSelected \nSelection \nRate \nImpact Ratio \nMale \n1390 \n667 \n48% \n1.00 \nFemale \n1181 \n555 \n47% \n0.979\n\nDocument 19: 9 \n \nExample 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the \nemployment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test \ndata. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 \nmonths have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data \nfrom 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias \naudit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and \nemployment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and \nconsideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. \n \nExample 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. \nThe employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may \nrely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of \nhistorical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a \nbias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other \nemployers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test \ndata.  \n \n§ 5-303 Published Results. \n(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following \npublicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  \n(1) \nThe date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall \ninclude the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of \nindividuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of \napplicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios \nfor all categories; and, \n(2) \nThe distribution date of the AEDT.\n\nDocument 17: 8 \n \n \nIntersectional Categories \n \n \n \n# of \nApplicants \nScoring \nRate \nImpact \nRatio \nHispanic or Latino \nMale \n16 \n75% \n1.00 \nFemale \n12 \n50% \n0.67 \nNon/Hispanic or \nLatino \nMale \nWhite \n20 \n35% \n0.47 \nBlack or African American \n20 \n50% \n0.67 \nNative Hawaiian or Pacific Islander \n4 \n75% \n1.00 \nAsian \n12 \n58.3% \n0.78 \nNative American or Alaska Native \n8 \n62.5 \n0.83 \nTwo or More Races \n12 \n50% \n0.67 \nFemale \nWhite \n20 \n40% \n0.53 \nBlack or African American \n12 \n50% \n.67 \nNative Hawaiian or Pacific Islander \n4 \n50% \n0.67 \nAsian \n12 \n25% \n0.33 \nNative American or Alaska Native \n8 \n62.5% \n0.83 \nTwo or More Races \n8 \n50% \n0.67 \n \nNote: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category.

The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 \nmonths have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data \nfrom 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias \naudit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and \nemployment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and \nconsideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. \n \nExample 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. \nThe employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT.

The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test \ndata.  \n \n§ 5-303 Published Results. \n(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following \npublicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  \n(1) \nThe date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall \ninclude the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of \nindividuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of \napplicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios \nfor all categories; and, \n(2) \nThe distribution date of the AEDT.\n\nDocument 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical \ndata of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers \nor employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency \nmay rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment \nagencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical \ndata from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such \nemployer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. \n(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or \nemployment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available \nto conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the \nbias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was \ngenerated and obtained.  \n \nExample 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias \naudit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit \nconducted using test data.\n\nDocument 11: 5 \n \n \nTest data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. \n§ 5-301 Bias Audit. \n(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has \npassed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  \n(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to \nmove forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: \n(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; \n(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; \n(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately \ncalculate the impact of the AEDT on: \ni. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  \nii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino \ncandidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and \niii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of \nHispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American \nfemale candidates). \n(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for \neach group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered \nfor promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and \n(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required \ncalculations because they fall within an unknown category. \n \nExample: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job \nposting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than \na year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not \nusing the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application \nprocess. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.\n\nDocument 12: Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job \nposting.

These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform \nGuidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4.

The Department received \ncomments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and \nadvocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, \npublished in December 2022.

The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 \nmonths have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data \nfrom 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias \naudit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and \nemployment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and \nconsideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. \n \nExample 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. \nThe employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may \nrely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of \nhistorical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration.

These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform \nGuidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations \nof employers and employment agencies under the new law. \n \nSpecifically, these new rules will: \n \nDefine terms; \n \nClarify the requirements for a bias audit;  \n \nClarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  \n \nClarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees \nand candidates for employment; and  \n \nClarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  \n \nThe Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received \ncomments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and \nadvocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, \npublished in December 2022. Those changes included:  \n \nModifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; \n \nClarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer \nor employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or \ndistributed the AEDT; \n \nRevising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;\n\nDocument 6: 2 \n \n \nClarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, \nrace/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; \n \nClarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; \n \nClarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they \nprovide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and \n \nClarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; \n \nThe Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including \nfrom employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various \nissues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: \n \nModifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” \nto expand its scope; \n \nAdding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are \nnot included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number \nbe included in the summary of results; \n \nAllowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being \nused for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; \n \nClarifying the examples of a bias audit; \n \nClarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the \nhistorical data of other employers or employment agencies; \n \nProviding examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with \nhistorical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; \n \nClarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must \nbe included in the summary of results. \n \nNew material is underlined. \n[Deleted material is in brackets.] \n \n“Shall” and “must” denote mandatory requirements and may be used interchangeably in the rules of this \ndepartment, unless otherwise specified or unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.\n\nDocument 11: 5 \n \n \nTest data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. \n§ 5-301 Bias Audit. \n(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has \npassed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  \n(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to \nmove forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: \n(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; \n(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; \n(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately \ncalculate the impact of the AEDT on: \ni. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  \nii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino \ncandidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and \niii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of \nHispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American \nfemale candidates). \n(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for \neach group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered \nfor promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and \n(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required \ncalculations because they fall within an unknown category. \n \nExample: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job \nposting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than \na year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not \nusing the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application \nprocess. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.\n\nDocument 15: 7 \n \n(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  \n(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision \nseparately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: \ni. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  \nii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino \ncandidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and \niii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of \nHispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American \nfemale candidates); and  \n(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required \ncalculations because they fall within an unknown category. \n(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and \n(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of \nthe data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a \ncategory is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the \nexclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded \ncategory.  \n \nExample: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must \nensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.", "conversation_history": [], "metadata": {"question_type": "vague", "seed_document_id": 5, "topic": "Bias Audits", "distracting_context": null, "situational_context": null, "original_questions": null, "fake_fact": null}}

Where such a \ncategory is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the \nexclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded \ncategory.  \n \nExample: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must \nensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.\n\nDocument 11: 5 \n \n \nTest data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. \n§ 5-301 Bias Audit. \n(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has \npassed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  \n(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to \nmove forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: \n(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; \n(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; \n(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately \ncalculate the impact of the AEDT on: \ni. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  \nii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino \ncandidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and \niii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of \nHispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American \nfemale candidates). \n(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for \neach group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered \nfor promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and \n(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required \ncalculations because they fall within an unknown category. \n \nExample: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job \nposting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than \na year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not \nusing the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application \nprocess. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.\n\nDocument 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and \nsex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) \npursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to \ndetermine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform \nGuidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations \nof employers and employment agencies under the new law. \n \nSpecifically, these new rules will: \n \nDefine terms; \n \nClarify the requirements for a bias audit;  \n \nClarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  \n \nClarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees \nand candidates for employment; and  \n \nClarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  \n \nThe Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received \ncomments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and \nadvocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, \npublished in December 2022. Those changes included:  \n \nModifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; \n \nClarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer \nor employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or \ndistributed the AEDT; \n \nRevising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;", "conversation_history": [], "metadata": {"question_type": "vague", "seed_document_id": 14, "topic": "Automated Employment Decision Tools (AEDTs)", "distracting_context": null, "situational_context": null, "original_questions": null, "fake_fact": null}}

Where such a \ncategory is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the \nexclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded \ncategory.  \n \nExample: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must \nensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.\n\nDocument 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above \nthe sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. \n \nScreen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or \nemployee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion \nprocess.  \n \nSelection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to \nmove forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated \nby dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the \ntotal number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  \n \nExample. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an \nAEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  \n \nSimplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition \nfor “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output \nmay take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization \n(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), \nrecommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a \nlist of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the \noutput from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF \nor transcribe a video or audio interview.\n\nDocument 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and \nsex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) \npursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to \ndetermine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform \nGuidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4.

The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 \nmonths have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data \nfrom 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias \naudit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and \nemployment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and \nconsideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. \n \nExample 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. \nThe employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT.

A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical \ndata of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers \nor employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency \nmay rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment \nagencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical \ndata from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such \nemployer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. \n(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or \nemployment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available \nto conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the \nbias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was \ngenerated and obtained.  \n \nExample 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias \naudit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit \nconducted using test data.\n\nDocument 11: 5 \n \n \nTest data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. \n§ 5-301 Bias Audit. \n(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has \npassed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  \n(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to \nmove forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: \n(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; \n(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; \n(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately \ncalculate the impact of the AEDT on: \ni. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  \nii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino \ncandidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and \niii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of \nHispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American \nfemale candidates). \n(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for \neach group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered \nfor promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and \n(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required \ncalculations because they fall within an unknown category. \n \nExample: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job \nposting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than \na year before the planned use of the AEDT.

The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 \nmonths have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data \nfrom 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias \naudit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and \nemployment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and \nconsideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. \n \nExample 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. \nThe employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT.

A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical \ndata of the AEDT.

Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or \nemployment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available \nto conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the \nbias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was \ngenerated and obtained.  \n \nExample 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias \naudit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit \nconducted using test data.\n\nDocument 11: 5 \n \n \nTest data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. \n§ 5-301 Bias Audit. \n(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has \npassed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  \n(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to \nmove forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: \n(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; \n(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; \n(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately \ncalculate the impact of the AEDT on: \ni. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  \nii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino \ncandidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and \niii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of \nHispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American \nfemale candidates). \n(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for \neach group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered \nfor promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and \n(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required \ncalculations because they fall within an unknown category. \n \nExample: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job \nposting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than \na year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not \nusing the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application \nprocess. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.\n\nDocument 12: Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job \nposting.

To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than \na year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not \nusing the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application \nprocess. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.\n\nDocument 15: 7 \n \n(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  \n(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision \nseparately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: \ni.

A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical \ndata of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers \nor employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency \nmay rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment \nagencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical \ndata from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such \nemployer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. \n(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or \nemployment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available \nto conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the \nbias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was \ngenerated and obtained.  \n \nExample 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias \naudit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit \nconducted using test data.\n\nDocument 19: 9 \n \nExample 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the \nemployment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test \ndata. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 \nmonths have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data \nfrom 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias \naudit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and \nemployment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and \nconsideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. \n \nExample 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. \nThe employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may \nrely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of \nhistorical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a \nbias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other \nemployers or employment agencies.

Those changes included:  \n \nModifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; \n \nClarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer \nor employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or \ndistributed the AEDT; \n \nRevising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;\n\nDocument 6: 2 \n \n \nClarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, \nrace/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; \n \nClarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; \n \nClarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they \nprovide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and \n \nClarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; \n \nThe Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including \nfrom employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various \nissues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: \n \nModifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” \nto expand its scope; \n \nAdding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are \nnot included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number \nbe included in the summary of results; \n \nAllowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being \nused for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; \n \nClarifying the examples of a bias audit; \n \nClarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the \nhistorical data of other employers or employment agencies; \n \nProviding examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with \nhistorical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; \n \nClarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must \nbe included in the summary of results. \n \nNew material is underlined. \n[Deleted material is in brackets.] \n \n“Shall” and “must” denote mandatory requirements and may be used interchangeably in the rules of this \ndepartment, unless otherwise specified or unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.\n\nDocument 11: 5 \n \n \nTest data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. \n§ 5-301 Bias Audit. \n(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has \npassed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  \n(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to \nmove forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: \n(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; \n(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; \n(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately \ncalculate the impact of the AEDT on: \ni. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  \nii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino \ncandidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and \niii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of \nHispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American \nfemale candidates). \n(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for \neach group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered \nfor promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and \n(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required \ncalculations because they fall within an unknown category. \n \nExample: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job \nposting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than \na year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not \nusing the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application \nprocess. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.\n\nDocument 15: 7 \n \n(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  \n(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision \nseparately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: \ni. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  \nii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino \ncandidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and \niii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of \nHispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American \nfemale candidates); and  \n(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required \ncalculations because they fall within an unknown category. \n(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and \n(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of \nthe data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a \ncategory is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the \nexclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded \ncategory.  \n \nExample: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must \nensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.", "conversation_history": [{"role": "user", "content": "I need to know the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "How can I help you with that?"}], "metadata": {"question_type": "conversational", "seed_document_id": 5, "topic": "Bias Audits", "distracting_context": null, "situational_context": null, "original_questions": null, "fake_fact": null}}

A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical \ndata of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers \nor employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency \nmay rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment \nagencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical \ndata from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such \nemployer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. \n(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or \nemployment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available \nto conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the \nbias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was \ngenerated and obtained.  \n \nExample 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias \naudit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit \nconducted using test data.\n\nDocument 19: 9 \n \nExample 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months.

The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 \nmonths have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data \nfrom 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias \naudit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and \nemployment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and \nconsideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. \n \nExample 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. \nThe employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may \nrely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of \nhistorical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration.

These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform \nGuidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4.

The Department received \ncomments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and \nadvocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, \npublished in December 2022.

A public hearing was held on \nNovember 4, 2022, and comments regarding the rule were received. DCWP proposed a second version of this \nrule on December 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on January 23, 2023, and comments regarding the rule \nwere received.  \n \nStatement of Basis and Purpose \n \nThe Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP” or “Department”) is adding rules to implement \nnew legislation regarding automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”). Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits \nemployers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has \nbeen subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly \navailable, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   \n \nThese rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and \nsex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) \npursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to \ndetermine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform \nGuidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations \nof employers and employment agencies under the new law.\n\nDocument 7: 3 \n \nSection 1.
