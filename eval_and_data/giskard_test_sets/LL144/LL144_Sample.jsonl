A public hearing was held on \nNovember 4, 2022, and comments regarding the rule were received. DCWP proposed a second version of this \nrule on December 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on January 23, 2023, and comments regarding the rule \nwere received.  \n \nStatement of Basis and Purpose \n \nThe Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP” or “Department”) is adding rules to implement \nnew legislation regarding automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”). Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits \nemployers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has \nbeen subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly \navailable, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   \n \nThese rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and \nsex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) \npursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to \ndetermine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform \nGuidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations \nof employers and employment agencies under the new law.\n\nDocument 7: 3 \n \nSection 1.

A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical \ndata of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers \nor employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency \nmay rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment \nagencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical \ndata from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such \nemployer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. \n(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or \nemployment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available \nto conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the \nbias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was \ngenerated and obtained.  \n \nExample 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias \naudit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit \nconducted using test data.\n\nDocument 19: 9 \n \nExample 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the \nemployment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test \ndata. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 \nmonths have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data \nfrom 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias \naudit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and \nemployment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and \nconsideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. \n \nExample 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. \nThe employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may \nrely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of \nhistorical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a \nbias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other \nemployers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test \ndata.  \n \n§ 5-303 Published Results. \n(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following \npublicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  \n(1) \nThe date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall \ninclude the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of \nindividuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of \napplicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios \nfor all categories; and, \n(2) \nThe distribution date of the AEDT.\n\nDocument 11: 5 \n \n \nTest data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. \n§ 5-301 Bias Audit. \n(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has \npassed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  \n(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to \nmove forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: \n(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; \n(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; \n(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately \ncalculate the impact of the AEDT on: \ni. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  \nii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino \ncandidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and \niii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of \nHispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American \nfemale candidates). \n(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for \neach group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered \nfor promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and \n(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required \ncalculations because they fall within an unknown category. \n \nExample: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job \nposting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than \na year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not \nusing the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application \nprocess. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.\n\nDocument 17: 8 \n \n \nIntersectional Categories \n \n \n \n# of \nApplicants \nScoring \nRate \nImpact \nRatio \nHispanic or Latino \nMale \n16 \n75% \n1.00 \nFemale \n12 \n50% \n0.67 \nNon/Hispanic or \nLatino \nMale \nWhite \n20 \n35% \n0.47 \nBlack or African American \n20 \n50% \n0.67 \nNative Hawaiian or Pacific Islander \n4 \n75% \n1.00 \nAsian \n12 \n58.3% \n0.78 \nNative American or Alaska Native \n8 \n62.5 \n0.83 \nTwo or More Races \n12 \n50% \n0.67 \nFemale \nWhite \n20 \n40% \n0.53 \nBlack or African American \n12 \n50% \n.67 \nNative Hawaiian or Pacific Islander \n4 \n50% \n0.67 \nAsian \n12 \n25% \n0.33 \nNative American or Alaska Native \n8 \n62.5% \n0.83 \nTwo or More Races \n8 \n50% \n0.67 \n \nNote: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category.
