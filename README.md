Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in text generation and question-answering, their effectiveness in AI legal and policy is limited by outdated knowledge, hallucinations, and inadequate reasoning in complex contexts. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems improve response accuracy by integrating external knowledge but struggle with retrieval errors, poor context integration, and high costs, particularly in interpreting qualitative and quantitative AI legal texts. This paper introduces a Hybrid Parameter-Adaptive RAG (HyPA-RAG) system tailored for AI legal and policy, exemplified by NYC Local Law 144 (LL144). HyPA-RAG uses a query complexity classifier for adaptive parameter tuning, a hybrid retrieval strategy combining dense, sparse, and knowledge graph methods, and an evaluation framework with specific question types and metrics. By dynamically adjusting parameters, HyPA-RAG significantly improves retrieval accuracy and response fidelity. Testing on LL144 shows enhanced correctness, faithfulness, and contextual precision, addressing the need for adaptable NLP systems in complex, high-stakes AI legal and policy applications
