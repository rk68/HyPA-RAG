New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection 
 
Notice of Adoption of Final Rule 
 
Pursuant to the authority vested in the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection by 
Sections 1043 and 2203(f) of the New York City Charter and Section 20-104(b) of the New York City 
Administrative Code, and in accordance with the requirements of Section 1043 of the New York City Charter, 
the Department amends Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York.  
 
An initial version of this rule was proposed and published on September 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on 
November 4, 2022, and comments regarding the rule were received. DCWP proposed a second version of this 
rule on December 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on January 23, 2023, and comments regarding the rule 
were received.  
 
Statement of Basis and Purpose 
 
The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP” or “Department”) is adding rules to implement 
new legislation regarding automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”). Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits 
employers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has 
been subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly 
available, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   
 
These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

Historical data.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex_situational', 'seed_document_id': 0, 'topic': 'Requirements'}","Certainly! An automated employment decision tool (AEDT) is defined as any computational process, derived from machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence, that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation, that is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons. However, it does not include tools that do not automate, support, substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-making processes and that do not materially impact natural persons, such as a junk email filter, firewall, antivirus software, calculator, spreadsheet, database, data set, or other compilation of data.

Before using an AEDT, employers and employment agencies in New York City must ensure that the tool has been subject to a bias audit conducted no more than one year prior to the use of the tool. The results of the most recent bias audit of the tool, as well as the distribution date of the tool to which the audit applies, must be made publicly available on the employer or employment agency's website prior to the use of the tool. Additionally, employers and employment agencies must provide notice to candidates or employees who reside in the city that an AEDT will be used in connection with the assessment or evaluation of such employee or candidate. The notice must be made no less than ten business days before such use and allow a candidate to request an alternative selection process or accommodation. The job qualifications and characteristics that the AEDT will use in the assessment of such candidate or employee must also be disclosed no less than 10 business days before such use.

"In the context of a bias audit, what is the definition of 'test data' and when can it be used?",'Test data' refers to data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.,"Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

As per the new legislation regarding automated employment decision tools (AEDT) in New York City, a bias audit is required to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of federal regulations. 

A bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. 

The purpose of a bias audit is to ensure that the AEDT is not unfairly discriminating against any particular group of people based on their race, ethnicity, or sex. By conducting a bias audit, employers and employment agencies can identify any potential biases in the AEDT and take steps to address them before using the tool to make employment decisions. 

It is important to note that the bias audit must be conducted no more than one year prior to the use of the AEDT, and a summary of the results of the most recent bias audit of such tool as well as the distribution date of the tool to which such audit applies must be made publicly available on the website of the employer or employment agency prior to the use of such tool.

I'm reviewing a policy document and came across the term 'Impact Ratio.' Can you explain what it means and how it is calculated?,"The 'Impact Ratio' can be calculated as either the selection rate for a category divided by the selection rate of the most selected category, or the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the highest scoring category.","Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

financial interest in an employer or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to 
use the  AEDT or in a vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT. 
 
Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.

Impact Ratio =        scoring rate of the highest scoring category 
 
 
Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification.

Example.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex_situational', 'seed_document_id': 10, 'topic': 'Metrics/Data'}","Sure, in the context of a bias audit of an AEDT (Artificial Intelligence Employment Decision Tool), the Impact Ratio is a measure of the impact that the AEDT has on different categories of candidates. Specifically, it measures the selection rate for a category divided by the selection rate of the most selected category. 

To calculate the Impact Ratio, you would first calculate the selection rate for each category of candidates (e.g. male vs. female, Hispanic or Latino vs. Black or African American, etc.). Then, you would compare each category's selection rate to the selection rate of the most selected category. Finally, you would divide the selection rate for each category by the selection rate of the most selected category to get the Impact Ratio for each category. 

The Impact Ratio is used to identify any potential bias in the AEDT's selection process and to ensure that the AEDT is not unfairly favoring or disfavoring certain categories of candidates.",True,"The agent's explanation of the Impact Ratio aligns with the ground truth, as it describes the calculation method accurately and provides context for its use.",1.0,0.7749715447425842,4.0,"The generated answer correctly explains the 'Impact Ratio' and its calculation method, addressing all components of the user query with only minor additional context that does not detract from its accuracy."

New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection 
 
Notice of Adoption of Final Rule 
 
Pursuant to the authority vested in the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection by 
Sections 1043 and 2203(f) of the New York City Charter and Section 20-104(b) of the New York City 
Administrative Code, and in accordance with the requirements of Section 1043 of the New York City Charter, 
the Department amends Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York.  
 
An initial version of this rule was proposed and published on September 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on 
November 4, 2022, and comments regarding the rule were received. DCWP proposed a second version of this 
rule on December 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on January 23, 2023, and comments regarding the rule 
were received.  
 
Statement of Basis and Purpose 
 
The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP” or “Department”) is adding rules to implement 
new legislation regarding automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”). Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits 
employers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has 
been subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly 
available, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   
 
These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

Historical data.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex_situational', 'seed_document_id': 4, 'topic': 'Requirements'}","Certainly! According to the New York City Administrative Code, an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT) is any computational process that uses machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence to issue simplified output, such as a score, classification, or recommendation, that is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons. 

In simpler terms, an AEDT is a tool that uses algorithms and data to help employers make decisions about hiring, promotions, or other employment-related matters. Examples of AEDTs include software that screens resumes, conducts pre-employment assessments, or analyzes employee performance data to make recommendations for promotions or terminations.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  


§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex_situational', 'seed_document_id': 6, 'topic': 'Definitions'}","Yes, I can explain the requirements for conducting a bias audit of an AEDT. According to the rules, an employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the planned use of the AEDT. The bias audit must use historical data of the AEDT, which may be from one or more employers or employment agencies that use the AEDT. 

The bias audit must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category that is required to be reported to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report. The bias audit must also compare the selection rates to the most selected category to determine an impact ratio. 

The impact ratio must be separately calculated for sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates), race/ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American female candidates). 

In addition, the bias audit must indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required calculations because they fall within an unknown category. An independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

The impact ratio is calculated by dividing the selection rate or scoring rate for a category by the selection rate or scoring rate of the most selected or highest scoring category. 

For example, if you have 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after using an AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%. The impact ratio for Hispanic women would be calculated by dividing their selection rate by the selection rate of the most selected category (e.g., non-Hispanic white men). 

It's important to note that the bias audit must use historical data, not test data, and must be conducted by an independent auditor who does not have a direct or material indirect financial interest in the employer, employment agency, or vendor.

Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition

may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF

Example.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex_situational', 'seed_document_id': 10, 'topic': 'Metrics/Data'}","Certainly! In the context of a bias audit of an AEDT (Artificial Intelligence Employment Decision Tool), ""Impact Ratio"" refers to a measure of the impact that the AEDT has on different categories of candidates, such as different races, ethnicities, or genders. 

There are two ways to calculate the Impact Ratio, depending on whether the AEDT is using a selection rate or a scoring rate:

1. Selection Rate Impact Ratio: This is calculated by dividing the selection rate for a particular category by the selection rate of the most selected category. The formula is:

   Impact Ratio = Selection rate for a category / Selection rate of the most selected category

2. Scoring Rate Impact Ratio: This is calculated by dividing the scoring rate for a particular category by the scoring rate for the highest scoring category. The formula is:

   Impact Ratio = Scoring rate for a category / Scoring rate of the highest scoring category

The Impact Ratio is used to identify any potential bias in the AEDT's decision-making process. If the Impact Ratio for a particular category is significantly lower than 1, it suggests that the AEDT is having a disproportionately negative impact on candidates in that category.",True,"The agent provided a detailed explanation of the 'Impact Ratio' and correctly described the two methods of calculation, aligning with the ground truth.",1.0,0.8215034604072571,5.0,"The generated answer accurately explains the term 'Impact Ratio', provides correct calculations for both selection and scoring rates, and includes relevant context about its application, fully addressing the user query."
"I want to conduct a bias audit for an AEDT. What are the requirements for calculating the impact ratio for sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectional categories? Are there any criteria for excluding certain categories from the calculations?","A bias audit of an AEDT must, at a minimum, calculate the selection rate and impact ratio for each category, separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race, perform the calculations for each group if the AEDT classifies candidates into specified groups, and indicate the number of individuals not included in the calculations due to falling within an unknown category.","Document 15: 7

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;

calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and

for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of

What information does the bias audit summary need to include?,"The bias audit summary needs to include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios for all categories.","Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Section 1.  Chapter 5 of Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York is amended to add Subchapter T to read 
as follows: 
Subchapter T: Automated Employment Decision Tools 
§ 5-300. Definitions. 
As used in this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings: 
 
Automated Employment Decision Tool. “Automated employment decision tool” or “AEDT” means 
“Automated employment decision tool” as defined by § 20-870 of the Code where the phrase “to 
substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making” means: 
i. 
to rely solely on a simplified output (score, tag, classification, ranking, etc.), with no other 
factors considered; or 
ii. 
 to use a simplified output as one of a set of criteria where the simplified output is weighted 
more than any other criterion in the set; or   
iii. 
to use a simplified output to overrule conclusions derived from other factors including 
human decision-making.  
  
Bias Audit. “Bias audit” means “Bias audit” as defined by § 20-870 of the Code.  
 
Candidate for Employment. “Candidate for employment” means a person who has applied for a specific 
employment position by submitting the necessary information or items in the format required by the 
employer or employment agency.  
 
Category. “Category” means any component 1 category required to be reported by employers pursuant 
to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States Code as specified in part 1602.7 of 
title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, as designated on the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission Employer Information Report EEO-1. 
 
Code. “Code” means the Administrative Code of the City of New York. 
 
Distribution Date. “Distribution date” means the date the employer or employment agency began using 
a specific AEDT.  
 
Employment Decision. “Employment decision” means “Employment decision” as defined by § 20-870 
of the Code. 
 
Employment Agency. “Employment agency” means “Employment agency” as defined by 6 RCNY § 5-
249.  
 
Historical data.",[],"{'question_type': 'simple', 'seed_document_id': 0, 'topic': 'Enforcement and Penalties', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","According to the text, an automated employment decision tool is defined as ""any computational process, derived from machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence, that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation, that is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons.""",True,,0.5,0.934004843235016,5.0,The generated answer is completely correct and accurately reflects the definition provided in the reference answer without any errors.
What must a bias audit of an AEDT calculate?,"A bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate and impact ratio for each category, including sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race. It must also indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT that fall within an unknown category.","Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

at any point during the bias audit, has a direct financial interest or a material indirect 
financial interest in an employer or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to 
use the  AEDT or in a vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT. 
 
Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.  
 
 
 
    _________selection rate for a category________  
Impact Ratio =        selection rate of the most selected category  
 
OR 
 
  
 
     ______scoring rate for a category__________  
Impact Ratio =        scoring rate of the highest scoring category 
 
 
Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;",[],"{'question_type': 'simple', 'seed_document_id': 9, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","According to section § 5-303 of the Chapter, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner before the use of an AEDT:

New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection 
 
Notice of Adoption of Final Rule 
 
Pursuant to the authority vested in the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection by 
Sections 1043 and 2203(f) of the New York City Charter and Section 20-104(b) of the New York City 
Administrative Code, and in accordance with the requirements of Section 1043 of the New York City Charter, 
the Department amends Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York.  
 
An initial version of this rule was proposed and published on September 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on 
November 4, 2022, and comments regarding the rule were received. DCWP proposed a second version of this 
rule on December 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on January 23, 2023, and comments regarding the rule 
were received.  
 
Statement of Basis and Purpose 
 
The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP” or “Department”) is adding rules to implement 
new legislation regarding automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”). Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits 
employers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has 
been subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly 
available, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   
 
These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.

What are the calculations required in the bias audit for the impact ratio?,"The calculations required in the bias audit for the impact ratio include separately calculating the impact of the AEDT on sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates), race/ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American female candidates).","Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and

Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'simple', 'seed_document_id': 15, 'topic': 'Metrics/Data', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","The calculations required in the bias audit for the impact ratio are:

on those individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
(c) Where an AEDT scores candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion, a bias 
audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the median score for the full sample of applicants;  
(2) Calculate the scoring rate for individuals in each category;

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;",[],"{'question_type': 'simple', 'seed_document_id': 14, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","According to the provided context, the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT (Automated Employment Decision Tools) are:

1. The audit must use historical data of the AEDT.
2. An individual employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment agencies only if they provided historical data from their own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if they have never used the AEDT.
3. If insufficient historical data is available to conduct a statistically significant bias audit, an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data. However, the summary of results of the bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was generated and obtained.
4. The bias audit must calculate the scoring rate for individuals in each category.
5. The bias audit must calculate the impact ratio for each category, which is the selection rate for a category divided by the selection rate of the most selected category.
6. An independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded category.
7. Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the results of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner.
8. The notice required by § 20-871(b)(1) of the Code must include instructions for how an individual can request an alternative selection process or a reasonable accommodation under other laws, if available.",False,"The agent's answer provides detailed requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT but does not mention the need to separately calculate the impact on sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories, nor does it indicate the number of individuals not included in the calculations due to being in an unknown category, which are key elements of the ground truth.",1.0,0.9665489196777344,2.0,"The generated answer includes some relevant information about bias audits but fails to address key components from the reference answer, such as the specific calculations required for selection rates and the impact of the AEDT on various categories."

It is used to analyze the selection rates and impact ratios of different race/ethnicity and gender categories in order to identify any potential bias in the selection process.,"Document 13: 6

§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers

Document 0: Subchapter 25: Automated Employment Decision Tools
§ 20-870 Definitions.
For the purposes of this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings:
   Automated employment decision tool. The term ""automated employment decision tool"" means any computational process, derived from machine
learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence, that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation,
that is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons. The term
""automated employment decision tool"" does not include a tool that does not automate, support, substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-
making processes and that does not materially impact natural persons, including, but not limited to, a junk email filter, firewall, antivirus software,
calculator, spreadsheet, database, data set, or other compilation of data.
   Bias audit. The term ""bias audit"" means an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor. Such bias audit shall include but not be limited to the
testing of an automated employment decision tool to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported
by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of
federal regulations.
   Employment decision. The term ""employment decision"" means to screen candidates for employment or employees for promotion within the city.

§ 20-871 Requirements for automated employment decision tools.
   a.   In the city, it shall be unlawful for an employer or an employment agency to use an automated employment decision tool to screen a candidate or
employee for an employment decision unless:
      1.   Such tool has been the subject of a bias audit conducted no more than one year prior to the use of such tool; and
      2.   A summary of the results of the most recent bias audit of such tool as well as the distribution date of the tool to which such audit applies has been
made publicly available on the website of the employer or employment agency prior to the use of such tool.
   b.   Notices required.",[],"{'question_type': 'simple', 'seed_document_id': 23, 'topic': 'Definitions', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","The purpose of a bias audit for automated employment decision tools is to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of federal regulations. The audit must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to determine an impact ratio. The audit must also use historical data of the AEDT, and if insufficient historical data is available, it may use test data. The results of the audit must be made publicly available on the website of the employer or employment agency prior to the use of the AEDT.",False,"The agent's answer is overly detailed and includes specific legal references and procedures that are not necessary to convey the main purpose of a bias audit, which is simply to assess the tool's disparate impact.",1.0,1.0,4.0,"The generated answer is mostly correct and addresses the purpose of a bias audit, but it includes excessive detail that, while accurate, is not necessary for the core understanding of the purpose."
What are the requirements for the published results of the bias audit?,The requirements for the published results of the required bias audit are clarified in the new rules. These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category that is required to be reported to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to determine an impact ratio.,"Document 9: 4 
 
iii. 
at any point during the bias audit, has a direct financial interest or a material indirect 
financial interest in an employer or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to 
use the  AEDT or in a vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT. 
 
Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.  
 
 
 
    _________selection rate for a category________  
Impact Ratio =        selection rate of the most selected category  
 
OR 
 
  
 
     ______scoring rate for a category__________  
Impact Ratio =        scoring rate of the highest scoring category 
 
 
Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;",[],"{'question_type': 'simple', 'seed_document_id': 9, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","According to section 5-303(a) of the law, before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and,

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex', 'seed_document_id': 11, 'topic': 'Metrics/Data', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","According to the legal document, a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the median score for the full sample of applicants and the scoring rate for individuals in each category. The categories that need to be considered are sex and race/ethnicity, and the selection rate for each category must be compared to the most selected category to determine an impact ratio. The impact ratio is calculated by dividing the selection rate for a category by the selection rate of the most selected category. 

Historical data of the AEDT must be used to conduct a bias audit, and it may be from one or more employers or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment agencies only if such employer or employment agency provided historical data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT.

What is the definition of 'Impact Ratio' and how is it calculated in relation to the selection rate or scoring rate of different categories?,"The 'Impact Ratio' can be calculated either as the selection rate for a category divided by the selection rate of the most selected category, or as the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the highest scoring category.","Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

at any point during the bias audit, has a direct financial interest or a material indirect 
financial interest in an employer or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to 
use the  AEDT or in a vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT. 
 
Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.  
 
 
 
    _________selection rate for a category________  
Impact Ratio =        selection rate of the most selected category  
 
OR 
 
  
 
     ______scoring rate for a category__________  
Impact Ratio =        scoring rate of the highest scoring category 
 
 
Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.

What is the difference between historical data and test data in the context of conducting a bias audit for an AEDT?,'Test data' refers to data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.,"Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection 
 
Notice of Adoption of Final Rule 
 
Pursuant to the authority vested in the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection by 
Sections 1043 and 2203(f) of the New York City Charter and Section 20-104(b) of the New York City 
Administrative Code, and in accordance with the requirements of Section 1043 of the New York City Charter, 
the Department amends Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York.  
 
An initial version of this rule was proposed and published on September 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on 
November 4, 2022, and comments regarding the rule were received. DCWP proposed a second version of this 
rule on December 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on January 23, 2023, and comments regarding the rule 
were received.  
 
Statement of Basis and Purpose 
 
The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP” or “Department”) is adding rules to implement 
new legislation regarding automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”). Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits 
employers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has 
been subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly 
available, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   
 
These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

The purpose of the audit is to assess the potential for bias in an automated employment decision tool (AEDT). The audit should include testing of the AEDT to evaluate its impact on natural persons and to determine whether it is substantially assisting or replacing discretionary decision-making processes. The audit should also calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category required to be reported to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to determine an impact ratio.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and

calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor's justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex', 'seed_document_id': 15, 'topic': 'Metrics/Data', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","Based on the provided context information, the following are the steps and criteria for conducting a bias audit of an AEDT:

1. Use historical data of the AEDT to conduct the bias audit. The historical data used may be from one or more employers or employment agencies that use the AEDT.

2. If insufficient historical data is available to conduct a statistically significant bias audit, an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data. The summary of results of the bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was generated and obtained.

3. Calculate the selection rate for each category by dividing the number of individuals moving forward by the total number of individuals.

4. Calculate the impact ratio for each category by dividing the selection rate for that category by the selection rate of the most selected category.

5. An independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded category.

6. Where an AEDT scores candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion, a bias audit must, at a minimum, calculate the median score for the full sample of applicants and calculate the scoring rate for individuals in each category.

7. Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner the date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios for all categories.

8. The employer must keep the summary of results and distribution date posted for at least 6 months after its latest use of the AEDT for an employment decision.

9. The notice required by § 20-871(b)(1) of the Code must include instructions for how an individual can request an alternative selection process or a reasonable accommodation under other laws, if available. Nothing in this subchapter requires an employer or employment agency to provide an alternative selection process.

10. To comply with § 20-871(b)(1) and (2) of the Code, an employer or employment agency may provide notice to a candidate for employment who resides in the city by doing any of the following: provide notice on the employment section of its website in a clear and conspicuous manner at least 10 business days before use of an AEDT, provide notice in a job posting at least 10 business days before use of an AEDT, or provide notice to candidates for employment via U.S. mail or e-mail at least 10 business days before use of an AEDT.",False,"The agent's answer provides detailed steps for conducting a bias audit but does not explicitly mention the requirement to calculate impact ratios specifically for sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectional categories, nor does it mention the exclusion of individuals in unknown categories, which are key points in the ground truth.",1.0,0.8589348793029785,4.0,"The generated answer provides a comprehensive overview of the steps and criteria for conducting a bias audit of an AEDT, correctly addressing the calculation of selection rates and impact ratios, but it lacks a specific mention of the need to indicate the number of individuals excluded due to unknown categories, which is a key component of the reference answer."
What information does an employer or employment agency need to make publicly available before using an AEDT?,"Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency must make publicly available on the employment section of their website the date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results. The summary should include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT that fall within an unknown category, and the number of applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios for all categories.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and,

"What are the specific calculations and requirements that must be performed during a bias audit of an AEDT for selection rates, impact ratios, and categories of sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectionality?","A bias audit of an AEDT must, at a minimum, calculate the selection rate for each category, calculate the impact ratio for each category, ensure that the calculations separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories, and indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT that are not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category.","Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Document 6: 2 
 
 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and

New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection 
 
Notice of Adoption of Final Rule 
 
Pursuant to the authority vested in the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection by 
Sections 1043 and 2203(f) of the New York City Charter and Section 20-104(b) of the New York City 
Administrative Code, and in accordance with the requirements of Section 1043 of the New York City Charter, 
the Department amends Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York.  
 
An initial version of this rule was proposed and published on September 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on 
November 4, 2022, and comments regarding the rule were received. DCWP proposed a second version of this 
rule on December 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on January 23, 2023, and comments regarding the rule 
were received.  
 
Statement of Basis and Purpose 
 
The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP” or “Department”) is adding rules to implement 
new legislation regarding automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”). Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits 
employers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has 
been subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly 
available, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   
 
These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

Section 1.  Chapter 5 of Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York is amended to add Subchapter T to read 
as follows: 
Subchapter T: Automated Employment Decision Tools 
§ 5-300. Definitions. 
As used in this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings: 
 
Automated Employment Decision Tool. “Automated employment decision tool” or “AEDT” means 
“Automated employment decision tool” as defined by § 20-870 of the Code where the phrase “to 
substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making” means: 
i. 
to rely solely on a simplified output (score, tag, classification, ranking, etc.), with no other 
factors considered; or 
ii. 
 to use a simplified output as one of a set of criteria where the simplified output is weighted 
more than any other criterion in the set; or   
iii. 
to use a simplified output to overrule conclusions derived from other factors including 
human decision-making.  
  
Bias Audit. “Bias audit” means “Bias audit” as defined by § 20-870 of the Code.  
 
Candidate for Employment. “Candidate for employment” means a person who has applied for a specific 
employment position by submitting the necessary information or items in the format required by the 
employer or employment agency.  
 
Category. “Category” means any component 1 category required to be reported by employers pursuant 
to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States Code as specified in part 1602.7 of 
title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, as designated on the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission Employer Information Report EEO-1. 
 
Code. “Code” means the Administrative Code of the City of New York. 
 
Distribution Date. “Distribution date” means the date the employer or employment agency began using 
a specific AEDT.  
 
Employment Decision. “Employment decision” means “Employment decision” as defined by § 20-870 
of the Code. 
 
Employment Agency. “Employment agency” means “Employment agency” as defined by 6 RCNY § 5-
249.  
 
Historical data.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex', 'seed_document_id': 4, 'topic': 'Definitions', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","In the context of automated employment decision tools, 'Bias Audit' means an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor. Such bias audit shall include but not be limited to the testing of an automated employment decision tool to assess the tool’s disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of federal regulations.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed explanation of a bias audit but does not align with the ground truth, which specifies that the definition is found in § 20-870 of the Code.",1.0,0.9667625427246094,4.0,"The generated answer provides a mostly correct definition of 'Bias Audit' in the context of automated employment decision tools, addressing the query comprehensively with minimal errors, though it lacks a direct reference to the specific legal definition mentioned in the reference answer."
What is the distinction between historical data and test data in the context of conducting a bias audit for an AEDT?,Test data refers to data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.,"Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex', 'seed_document_id': 18, 'topic': 'Definitions', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","In the context of conducting a bias audit for an AEDT, historical data refers to data that has been collected from the actual use of the AEDT by one or more employers or employment agencies in the past. On the other hand, test data refers to data that is used to conduct a bias audit but is not historical data. Test data may be used when there is insufficient historical data available to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. However, if an employer or employment agency has its own historical data from the use of the AEDT, it may not rely on a bias audit that uses historical data from other employers or employment agencies.",False,"The agent's answer is overly detailed and includes information about historical data that is not necessary to answer the question.

Under what condition can an independent auditor exclude a category from the required calculations for impact ratio?,An independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio.,"Document 16: (d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of

category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

iii. 
at any point during the bias audit, has a direct financial interest or a material indirect 
financial interest in an employer or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to 
use the  AEDT or in a vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT. 
 
Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.  
 
 
 
    _________selection rate for a category________

OR 
 
  
 
     ______scoring rate for a category__________  
Impact Ratio =        scoring rate of the highest scoring category 
 
 
Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;",[],"{'question_type': 'complex', 'seed_document_id': 9, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","According to the rules, a bias audit of an AEDT must at a minimum:

§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT.

What is the process for calculating the impact ratio in a bias audit of an AEDT?,A bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category that is required to be reported to the EEOC and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to determine an impact ratio. The calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures.,"Document 9: 4 
 
iii. 
at any point during the bias audit, has a direct financial interest or a material indirect 
financial interest in an employer or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to 
use the  AEDT or in a vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT. 
 
Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.  
 
 
 
    _________selection rate for a category________  
Impact Ratio =        selection rate of the most selected category  
 
OR 
 
  
 
     ______scoring rate for a category__________  
Impact Ratio =        scoring rate of the highest scoring category 
 
 
Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 


ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and

the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and

""automated employment decision tool"" does not include a tool that does not automate, support, substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-
making processes and that does not materially impact natural persons, including, but not limited to, a junk email filter, firewall, antivirus software,
calculator, spreadsheet, database, data set, or other compilation of data.
   Bias audit. The term ""bias audit"" means an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor. Such bias audit shall include but not be limited to the
testing of an automated employment decision tool to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported
by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of
federal regulations.
   Employment decision. The term ""employment decision"" means to screen candidates for employment or employees for promotion within the city.

What criteria must be met in order to exclude a category from the required calculations for the impact ratio in a bias audit of an AEDT?,"A bias audit of an AEDT must, at a minimum, calculate the selection rate for each category, calculate the impact ratio for each category, ensure that the calculations separately calculate the impact on sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories, and indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT that are not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category.","Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.

What calculations are required for a bias audit of an AEDT according to the new rules?,"A bias audit of an AEDT must, at a minimum, calculate the selection rate for each category, calculate the impact ratio for each category, separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories, and indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT that are not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category.","Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Document 6: 2 
 
 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.",[],"{'question_type': 'distracting element', 'seed_document_id': 5, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': 'These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and \nsex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) \npursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to \ndetermine an impact ratio.

Why is it important to conduct a bias audit for automated employment decision tools with regards to persons of any component 1 category required to be reported by employers?,The purpose of a bias audit for automated employment decision tools is to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported by employers.,"Document 23: The New York City Council

Document 0: Subchapter 25: Automated Employment Decision Tools
§ 20-870 Definitions.
For the purposes of this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings:
   Automated employment decision tool. The term ""automated employment decision tool"" means any computational process, derived from machine
learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence, that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation,
that is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons. The term
""automated employment decision tool"" does not include a tool that does not automate, support, substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-
making processes and that does not materially impact natural persons, including, but not limited to, a junk email filter, firewall, antivirus software,
calculator, spreadsheet, database, data set, or other compilation of data.
   Bias audit. The term ""bias audit"" means an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor. Such bias audit shall include but not be limited to the
testing of an automated employment decision tool to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported
by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of
federal regulations.
   Employment decision. The term ""employment decision"" means to screen candidates for employment or employees for promotion within the city.
(L.L. 2021/144, 12/11/2021, eff. 1/1/2023)
§ 20-871 Requirements for automated employment decision tools.
   a.   In the city, it shall be unlawful for an employer or an employment agency to use an automated employment decision tool to screen a candidate or
employee for an employment decision unless:
      1.   Such tool has been the subject of a bias audit conducted no more than one year prior to the use of such tool; and
      2.   A summary of the results of the most recent bias audit of such tool as well as the distribution date of the tool to which such audit applies has been
made publicly available on the website of the employer or employment agency prior to the use of such tool.

What are the requirements for conducting a bias audit of an AEDT used to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job posting?,"The requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT include calculating the selection rate for each category, calculating the impact ratio for each category, separately calculating the impact of the AEDT on sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race, performing the calculations for each group if the AEDT classifies candidates into specified groups, and indicating the number of individuals not included in the calculations due to falling within an unknown category.","Document 14: Data

(c) Where an AEDT scores candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion, a bias

(2) Calculate the scoring rate for individuals in each category;

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;",[],"{'question_type': 'distracting element', 'seed_document_id': 14, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': 'Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job \nposting.

at any point during the bias audit, has a direct financial interest or a material indirect 
financial interest in an employer or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to 
use the  AEDT or in a vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT. 
 
Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.  
 
 
 
    _________selection rate for a category________

Impact Ratio =        scoring rate of the highest scoring category 
 
 
Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;",[],"{'question_type': 'distracting element', 'seed_document_id': 9, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': '9 \n \nExample 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months.

2. The distribution date of the AEDT.

Therefore, the published results of the bias audit for the AEDT should include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios for all categories.",False,"The agent's answer does not fully align with the ground truth, as it lacks specific details about separately calculating the impact of the AEDT on sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories, which are mentioned in the ground truth.",1.0,0.6937131881713867,3.0,"The generated answer partially addresses the user query by including relevant information about the bias audit but lacks specific mention of the separate calculations for sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectional categories as highlighted in the reference answer."
"When conducting a bias audit for an AEDT, is it necessary to calculate the impact ratio for each race/ethnicity and sex category separately?",The purpose of a bias audit for an AEDT is to calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category required to be reported to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to determine an impact ratio.,"Document 9: 4 
 
iii. 
at any point during the bias audit, has a direct financial interest or a material indirect 
financial interest in an employer or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to 
use the  AEDT or in a vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT. 
 
Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.  
 
 
 
    _________selection rate for a category________  
Impact Ratio =        selection rate of the most selected category  
 
OR 
 
  
 
     ______scoring rate for a category__________  
Impact Ratio =        scoring rate of the highest scoring category 
 
 
Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job

a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American

(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.

that is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons. The term
""automated employment decision tool"" does not include a tool that does not automate, support, substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-
making processes and that does not materially impact natural persons, including, but not limited to, a junk email filter, firewall, antivirus software,
calculator, spreadsheet, database, data set, or other compilation of data.
   Bias audit. The term ""bias audit"" means an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor. Such bias audit shall include but not be limited to the
testing of an automated employment decision tool to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported
by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of
federal regulations.

"I'm considering using an AEDT for the first time. Can I rely on a bias audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or can I conduct a bias audit using test data? What is the definition of 'test data' in the context of a bias audit?",'Test data' refers to data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.,"Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection 
 
Notice of Adoption of Final Rule 
 
Pursuant to the authority vested in the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection by 
Sections 1043 and 2203(f) of the New York City Charter and Section 20-104(b) of the New York City 
Administrative Code, and in accordance with the requirements of Section 1043 of the New York City Charter, 
the Department amends Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York.  
 
An initial version of this rule was proposed and published on September 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on 
November 4, 2022, and comments regarding the rule were received. DCWP proposed a second version of this 
rule on December 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on January 23, 2023, and comments regarding the rule 
were received.  
 
Statement of Basis and Purpose 
 
The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP” or “Department”) is adding rules to implement 
new legislation regarding automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”). Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits 
employers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has 
been subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly 
available, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   
 
These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

Can you explain the meaning of test data in the context of a bias audit according to Local Law 144 and other policy documents?,Test data refers to data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.,"Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT.

Historical data is data that has been collected from the actual use of an automated employment decision tool (AEDT) in the past. Test data, on the other hand, is generated specifically for the purpose of conducting a bias audit when there is insufficient historical data available to conduct a statistically significant audit. 

Test data is used to simulate the use of an AEDT in a controlled environment, and the results of the bias audit using test data are used to evaluate the potential impact of the AEDT on employment decisions. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was generated and obtained. 

It is important to note that while an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available, an employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test data when there is statistically significant historical data available from its own use of the AEDT.",False,"The agent's answer is overly detailed and includes information beyond the ground truth, which simply states that test data refers to data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.",0.8333333333333334,0.9740277528762816,5.0,"The generated answer accurately explains the meaning of test data in the context of a bias audit according to Local Law 144, covering all components of the query without any errors."
"I am an employer using an AEDT to score applicants for 'culture fit' and want to ensure a bias audit was conducted before using the AEDT. What is the threshold for excluding a category, such as sex or race/ethnicity, from the required calculations for impact ratio?",An independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio.,"Document 16: (d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.

"As a lawyer reviewing the requirements for bias audits in accordance with Local Law 144, can you explain what 'test data' means in the context of a bias audit?","In the context of a bias audit, 'test data' refers to data used to conduct the audit that is not historical data.","Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'situational', 'seed_document_id': 18, 'topic': 'Definitions', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': '{""description"": ""A legal chatbot that provides assistance with Local Law 144 and other policy documents.""}\n<situation>A lawyer is reviewing the requirements for bias audits in accordance with Local Law 144.</situation>', 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","In the context of a bias audit under Local Law 144, 'test data' refers to data that is used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. This means that test data is not based on actual past use of the automated employment decision tool (AEDT) by the employer or employment agency, but rather is generated specifically for the purpose of conducting the bias audit. 

According to Section 5-302(b) of the law, an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if there is insufficient historical data available to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. However, if an employer or employment agency has statistically significant data from its own use of the AEDT, it may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test data. 

If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was generated and obtained, as stated in Section 5-302(b) of the law.",False,"The agent's answer is overly detailed and includes information not present in the ground truth. The ground truth simply defines 'test data' as data used for the audit that is not historical, without the additional context provided by the agent.",0.75,0.9361295104026794,5.0,"The generated answer accurately defines 'test data' in the context of a bias audit, aligns closely with the reference answer, and provides additional relevant information without any errors."
What are the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT according to Local Law 144 and other policy documents?,"A bias audit of an AEDT must, at a minimum, calculate the selection rate for each category, calculate the impact ratio for each category, ensure that the impact calculations are done separately for sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories, and indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT that are not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category.","Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Document 6: 2 
 
 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than

(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.

1. The bias audit must use historical data of the AEDT. The historical data used may be from one or more employers or employment agencies that use the AEDT.

2. An individual employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment agencies only if such employer or employment agency provided historical data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT.

4. The bias audit must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to determine an impact ratio.

5. Where an AEDT scores candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion, a bias audit must, at a minimum, calculate the median score for the full sample of applicants and calculate the scoring rate for individuals in each category.

6. The results of the bias audit must be made publicly available on the employment section of the employer or employment agency's website in a clear and conspicuous manner.

8. The notice required by § 20-871(b)(1) of the Code must include instructions for how an individual can request an alternative selection process or a reasonable accommodation under other laws, if available.

these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'situational', 'seed_document_id': 13, 'topic': 'Definitions', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': '{""user"": ""I am a lawyer working on Local Law 144 and other policy documents.

The purpose of the AEDT in the bias audit is to assess whether the tool is producing biased results in the selection process based on race and ethnicity categories. The bias audit must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category that is required to be reported to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to determine an impact ratio. This is consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. The AEDT is used to score applicants for employment positions and the bias audit is conducted using historical data of the AEDT. The results of the bias audit must be publicly available and certain notices must be provided to employees or job candidates.",False,"The agent's answer provides excessive detail about the bias audit process and the role of the AEDT, but it does not accurately define what the AEDT is or its primary purpose, which is to provide historical data for conducting a bias audit.",0.9285714285714286,0.8157958388328552,4.0,"The generated answer correctly explains the purpose of the AEDT in the bias audit and covers relevant details, but it includes some extraneous information that, while accurate, is not directly necessary for the query."

"As a student from Canada who will be studying in Europe, what can an independent auditor exclude from the required calculations for impact ratio?",An independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio.,"Document 16: (d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of

category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition

may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 


Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available

For example, if an AEDT is used to screen job applicants and the selection rate for male candidates is 50% while the selection rate for female candidates is 40%, the impact ratio for female candidates would be 0.8 (40% divided by 50%). This indicates that the AEDT has a negative impact on female candidates, as they are less likely to be selected than male candidates. 

It's worth noting that impact ratios should be calculated separately for different categories, such as sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectional categories.

New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection 
 
Notice of Adoption of Final Rule 
 
Pursuant to the authority vested in the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection by 
Sections 1043 and 2203(f) of the New York City Charter and Section 20-104(b) of the New York City 
Administrative Code, and in accordance with the requirements of Section 1043 of the New York City Charter, 
the Department amends Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York.  
 
An initial version of this rule was proposed and published on September 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on 
November 4, 2022, and comments regarding the rule were received. DCWP proposed a second version of this 
rule on December 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on January 23, 2023, and comments regarding the rule 
were received.  
 
Statement of Basis and Purpose 
 
The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP” or “Department”) is adding rules to implement 
new legislation regarding automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”). Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits 
employers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has 
been subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly 
available, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   
 
These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

""automated employment decision tool"" does not include a tool that does not automate, support, substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-
making processes and that does not materially impact natural persons, including, but not limited to, a junk email filter, firewall, antivirus software,
calculator, spreadsheet, database, data set, or other compilation of data.
   Bias audit. The term ""bias audit"" means an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor. Such bias audit shall include but not be limited to the
testing of an automated employment decision tool to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported
by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of

What are the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT and what changes were made in the second version of the proposed rules?,"The requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT include calculating the selection rate and impact ratio for each category. In the second version of the proposed rules, changes were made to the definition of AEDT and the requirements for an independent auditor were clarified.","Document 14: Data 
on those individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
(c) Where an AEDT scores candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion, a bias 
audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the median score for the full sample of applicants;  
(2) Calculate the scoring rate for individuals in each category;

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 


Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.

What are the requirements for a bias audit and what is test data in the context of a bias audit?,The requirements for a bias audit include calculating the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category and comparing the selection rates to determine an impact ratio. Test data in the context of a bias audit refers to data used to conduct the audit that is not historical data.,"Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus;

The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.

ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.",[],"{'question_type': 'double', 'seed_document_id': 5, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': [{'question': 'What are the requirements for a bias audit?', 'answer': 'A bias audit must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category and compare the selection rates to determine an impact ratio.'}, {'question': 'What is test data in the context of a bias audit?', 'answer': 'Test data is data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.'}], 'fake_fact': None}","In the context of a bias audit, the requirements for a bias audit are as follows:

1. An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.

   e. Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required calculations because they fall within an unknown category.

Test data, on the other hand, refers to data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. An employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. However, if a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was generated and obtained.",False,The agent's answer provides excessive detail and includes specific requirements that are not necessary for a general understanding of bias audit requirements.

A bias audit must calculate the selection rate and impact ratio for each category, including sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectional categories.","Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios

(c) An employer or employment agency must keep the summary of results and distribution date posted for 
at least 6 months after its latest use of the AEDT for an employment decision.   
 
§ 5-304 Notice to Candidates and Employees.  
(a) The notice required by § 20-871(b)(1) of the Code must include instructions for how an individual can 
request an alternative selection process or a reasonable accommodation under other laws, if 
available. Nothing in this subchapter requires an employer or employment agency to provide an 
alternative selection process. 
(b) To comply with § 20-871(b)(1) and (2) of the Code, an employer or employment agency may provide 
notice to a candidate for employment who resides in the city by doing any of the following: 
(1) Provide notice on the employment section of its website in a clear and conspicuous manner 
at least 10 business days before use of an AEDT;  
(2) Provide notice in a job posting at least 10 business days before use of an AEDT; or, 
(3) Provide notice to candidates for employment via U.S. mail or e-mail at least 10 business days

A bias audit must calculate the selection rate and impact ratio for each category, including sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories.","Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category.

(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.

Such bias audit shall include but not be limited to the testing of an automated employment decision tool to assess the potential for disparate impact based on race, national origin, age, religion, disability, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, marital status, partnership status, caregiver status, status as a victim of domestic violence, or any other characteristic protected by law.",False,"The agent's answer is mostly correct but lacks the specific mention of assessing the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported by employers, which is part of the ground truth definition.",0.75,0.7850571274757385,5.0,"The generated answer accurately defines both 'Automated Employment Decision Tool' and 'Bias audit' with no factual errors, closely aligning with the reference answer."
What are the requirements for a bias audit and what is test data?,The requirements for a bias audit include calculating the selection rate and impact ratio for each category. Test data is the data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.,"Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Document 6: 2 
 
 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

“Shall” and “must” denote mandatory requirements and may be used interchangeably in the rules of this 
department, unless otherwise specified or unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.",[],"{'question_type': 'double', 'seed_document_id': 5, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': [{'question': 'What are the requirements for a bias audit?', 'answer': 'A bias audit must calculate the selection rate for each category and the impact ratio for each category.'}, {'question': 'What is test data?', 'answer': 'Test data is data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.'}], 'fake_fact': None}","The requirements for a bias audit are outlined in section 5-301 of Chapter 5 of the legal document.

The audit must also indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT that are not included in the required calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 

Test data is defined in section 5 of the document as data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. An employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.

They can provide notice on the employment section of its website, in a job posting, or via U.S. mail or e-mail.","Document 22: 10 
 
(2) Provide notice in a job posting at least 10 business days before use of an AEDT; or, 
(3) Provide notice via U.S. mail or e-mail at least 10 business days before use of an AEDT.  
(d) To comply with § 20-871(b)(3) of the Code, an employer or employment agency must: 
(1) Provide information on the employment section of its website in a clear and conspicuous 
manner about its AEDT data retention policy, the type of data collected for the AEDT, and the 
source of the data;

promotion why disclosure of such information would violate local, state, or federal law, or 
interfere with a law enforcement investigation.

(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and

(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.

ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.",[],"{'question_type': 'double', 'seed_document_id': 16, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': [{'question': 'What are the requirements for conducting a bias audit?', 'answer': 'An independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio.'}, {'question': 'What is the purpose of conducting a bias audit?', 'answer': 'To assess the impact of the AEDT on different categories, such as sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectional categories.'}], 'fake_fact': None}","According to the context information provided, the requirements and purpose of conducting a bias audit are as follows:

1. Requirements: 
- A bias audit must use historical data of the AEDT (Automated Employment Decision Tool).
- An employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment agencies only if they provided historical data from their own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if they have never used the AEDT.
- An employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.
- An independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio.

2. Purpose:
- A bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to determine an impact ratio.

Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the

Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and

The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.

Document 0: Subchapter 25: Automated Employment Decision Tools
§ 20-870 Definitions.
For the purposes of this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings:
   Automated employment decision tool. The term ""automated employment decision tool"" means any computational process, derived from machine
learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence, that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation,
that is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons. The term
""automated employment decision tool"" does not include a tool that does not automate, support, substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-
making processes and that does not materially impact natural persons, including, but not limited to, a junk email filter, firewall, antivirus software,
calculator, spreadsheet, database, data set, or other compilation of data.
   Bias audit. The term ""bias audit"" means an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor. Such bias audit shall include but not be limited to the
testing of an automated employment decision tool to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported
by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of
federal regulations.

§ 20-873 Enforcement.
The corporation counsel or such other persons designated by the corporation counsel on behalf of the department may initiate in any court of competent
jurisdiction any action or proceeding that may be appropriate or necessary for correction of any violation issued pursuant this subchapter, including
mandating compliance with the provisions of this chapter or such other relief as may be appropriate.

This can include relying solely on a simplified output, using a simplified output as one of a set of criteria where the simplified output is weighted more than any other criterion in the set, or using a simplified output to overrule conclusions derived from other factors including human decision-making.

In terms of penalties for violating the requirements associated with AEDTs, Section 20-872 of the New York City Administrative Code states that any person who violates any provision of the subchapter or any rule promulgated pursuant to the subchapter is liable for a civil penalty of not more than $500 for a first violation and each additional violation occurring on the same day as the first violation, and not less than $500 nor more than $1,500 for each subsequent violation. Each day on which an AEDT is used in violation of the requirements gives rise to a separate violation, and failure to provide any notice to a candidate or an employee in violation of certain provisions constitutes a separate violation. The corporation counsel or other designated persons may initiate any action or proceeding necessary for correction of any violation, including mandating compliance with the provisions of the subchapter or other appropriate relief.",False,"While the agent's definition of an automated employment decision tool is mostly accurate, it lacks the mention of machine learning, statistical modeling, and data analytics, which are key components of the definition. Additionally, the penalties described are more detailed than the ground truth, which may lead to confusion about the essential information.",1.0,0.8497533202171326,5.0,"The generated answer accurately defines an automated employment decision tool and thoroughly explains the penalties for violations, aligning closely with the reference answer without any factual errors."
What is the relationship between the definition of 'test data' in a bias audit and the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT?,"In a bias audit, 'test data' refers to the data used for the audit that is not historical data. On the other hand, a bias audit of an AEDT requires calculating the selection rate and impact ratio for each category, including sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectional categories. Therefore, the definition of 'test data' in a bias audit is distinct from the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT, but both are crucial components of ensuring fairness and identifying potential biases in automated systems.","Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

How does the data requirements for a bias audit relate to the process of assessing the impact of an AEDT on different categories?,"A bias audit is a process used to assess the impact of an AEDT on different categories, such as sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectional categories. The data requirements for a bias audit involve using historical data of the AEDT. However, if there is insufficient historical data available, an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data. In both cases, the goal is to evaluate any potential biases and disparities in the AEDT's impact on different categories.","Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1)

may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT.

"What is the relationship between test data and the requirements for a bias audit, and how do they differ?","Test data refers to the data used specifically for conducting a bias audit, which is not historical data. On the other hand, the requirements for a bias audit include calculating the selection rate and impact ratio for various categories, such as sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectional categories. While test data is a subset of the data used in a bias audit, the requirements for a bias audit involve specific calculations and analysis of different categories to identify and address biases.","Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other

(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to

(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'compare', 'seed_document_id': 18, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': [{'question': 'What is the definition of test data?', 'answer': 'Test data means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.'}, {'question': 'What are the requirements for a bias audit?', 'answer': 'A bias audit must calculate the selection rate and impact ratio for each category, including sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories.'}], 'fake_fact': None}","According to Section 5-302 of Subchapter 25 of Chapter 5 of Title 20 of the administrative code of the city of New York, a bias audit conducted pursuant to Section 5-301 of the same subchapter must use historical data of the automated employment decision tool (AEDT). However, an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. This means that test data can be used as a substitute for historical data in certain circumstances. 

Test data is defined in Section 20-870 of the same subchapter as data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. In other words, test data is data that is generated specifically for the purpose of conducting a bias audit, rather than data that has been collected over time from the actual use of the AEDT. 

In summary, while historical data is the preferred type of data to use in a bias audit, test data can be used as a substitute if historical data is not available or insufficient. Test data is a type of data that is specifically generated for the purpose of conducting a bias audit, while historical data is data that has been collected over time from the actual use of the AEDT.",False,"The agent's answer focuses on the definitions and usage of test data and historical data in a bias audit but does not address the specific requirements for a bias audit, such as calculating selection rates and impact ratios for various categories.

"What are the differences and similarities between 'selection rate' and 'scoring rate', and how do they relate to each other?","'Selection rate' refers to the rate at which individuals are selected or classified in a hiring process or by an AEDT, while 'scoring rate' pertains to the rate at which individuals receive a score above the sample's median score, calculated by an AEDT. Both rates involve evaluating individuals based on certain criteria, but 'selection rate' focuses on advancement in a process, while 'scoring rate' focuses on achieving a score above a threshold. In some cases, the two rates may be related, such as when a higher 'scoring rate' leads to a higher 'selection rate' for certain categories of individuals.","Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

financial interest in an employer or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to 
use the  AEDT or in a vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT. 
 
Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.

Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on

What calculations are required in the bias audit and when can an independent auditor exclude a category from these calculations?,"In the bias audit, calculations include determining the impact ratio for each category and assessing the impact of the AEDT on various demographic categories. An independent auditor can exclude a category from the calculations if it represents less than 2% of the data being used for the audit.","Document 16: (d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of

category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded

An employer or employment agency can rely on a bias audit that uses test data if there is insufficient historical data available to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.

A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency

to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of

move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;",[],"{'question_type': 'compare', 'seed_document_id': 14, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': [{'question': 'What must be calculated in a bias audit of an AEDT?', 'answer': 'A bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category and compare the selection rates to determine an impact ratio.'}, {'question': 'What are the requirements for the published results of a bias audit?', 'answer': 'The requirements for the published results of a bias audit include providing notices to employees and candidates for employment and clarifying other obligations for the employer or employment agency.'}], 'fake_fact': None}","The calculations required in a bias audit of an AEDT include calculating the selection rate and impact ratio for each category, separately calculating the impact of the AEDT on sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race, and indicating the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT that are not included in the required calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 

The requirements for the published results of the bias audit include providing a summary of the results of the audit, including the calculations required in the bias audit, the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT, and the number of individuals excluded from the calculations because they fall within an unknown category. The published results must also include the independent auditor's justification for any exclusion of a category that represents less than 2% of the data being used for the bias audit.

The two definitions are related in that the 'Scoring Rate' is a metric that can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of an AEDT in the screening process. The AEDT generates a score for each candidate, and the 'Scoring Rate' measures the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above the sample’s median score. This metric can be used to determine whether the AEDT is effectively screening candidates or whether it is introducing bias into the process.

Document 0: Subchapter 25: Automated Employment Decision Tools
§ 20-870 Definitions.
For the purposes of this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings:
   Automated employment decision tool. The term ""automated employment decision tool"" means any computational process, derived from machine
learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence, that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation,
that is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons. The term
""automated employment decision tool"" does not include a tool that does not automate, support, substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-
making processes and that does not materially impact natural persons, including, but not limited to, a junk email filter, firewall, antivirus software,
calculator, spreadsheet, database, data set, or other compilation of data.
   Bias audit. The term ""bias audit"" means an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor. Such bias audit shall include but not be limited to the
testing of an automated employment decision tool to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported
by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of
federal regulations.
   Employment decision. The term ""employment decision"" means to screen candidates for employment or employees for promotion within the city.
(L.L. 2021/144, 12/11/2021, eff. 1/1/2023)
§ 20-871 Requirements for automated employment decision tools.
   a.   In the city, it shall be unlawful for an employer or an employment agency to use an automated employment decision tool to screen a candidate or
employee for an employment decision unless:
      1.   Such tool has been the subject of a bias audit conducted no more than one year prior to the use of such tool; and
      2.   A summary of the results of the most recent bias audit of such tool as well as the distribution date of the tool to which such audit applies has been
made publicly available on the website of the employer or employment agency prior to the use of such tool.

§ 20-873 Enforcement.
The corporation counsel or such other persons designated by the corporation counsel on behalf of the department may initiate in any court of competent
jurisdiction any action or proceeding that may be appropriate or necessary for correction of any violation issued pursuant this subchapter, including
mandating compliance with the provisions of this chapter or such other relief as may be appropriate.

What is the relationship between the requirements for a bias audit and the concept of test data?,"The requirements for a bias audit involve calculating selection rates for different demographic categories to determine an impact ratio. Test data, on the other hand, refers to the data used in a bias audit that is not historical data. Test data is necessary to conduct a bias audit and apply the requirements. In summary, the requirements for a bias audit rely on analyzing selection rates, while test data is the specific type of data used to perform the audit.","Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Document 6: 2 
 
 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.",[],"{'question_type': 'compare', 'seed_document_id': 5, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': [{'question': 'What are the requirements for a bias audit?', 'answer': 'A bias audit must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category and compare the selection rates to determine an impact ratio.'}, {'question': 'What is test data in the context of a bias audit?', 'answer': 'Test data is data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.'}], 'fake_fact': None}","According to the legal information provided, an employer or employment agency must conduct a bias audit of an automated employment decision tool (AEDT) using historical data of the AEDT. However, if there is insufficient historical data available to conduct a statistically significant bias audit, the employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data. This means that test data is an alternative to historical data when conducting a bias audit, but it can only be used when there is not enough historical data available.",False,"The agent's answer does not fully address the relationship between the requirements for a bias audit and test data.

What is the relationship between the purpose of a bias audit and when an employer can rely on a bias audit that uses test data?,"The purpose of a bias audit is to calculate the impact ratio for each category and ensure non-discriminatory impact. An employer can rely on a bias audit that uses test data when there is insufficient historical data available to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. In other words, the purpose of the bias audit informs the circumstances in which an employer can use test data for the audit.","Document 17: 8

these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.

2. A summary of the results of the most recent bias audit of such tool as well as the distribution date of the tool to which such audit applies has been made publicly available on the website of the employer or employment agency prior to the use of such tool.
3. The employer or employment agency provides notices to each employee or candidate who resides in the city, including information about the use of the tool, the job qualifications and characteristics that the tool will use in the assessment of such candidate or employee, and information about the type of data collected for the automated employment decision tool, the source of such data, and the employer or employment agency’s data retention policy upon written request by a candidate or employee.",False,"The agent's answer includes additional requirements beyond the ground truth, making it more detailed but not directly aligned with the specific requirements stated in the ground truth.",1.0,0.927391231060028,4.0,"The generated answer correctly addresses the requirements for using an automated employment decision tool in New York, but it includes additional information that, while relevant, is not part of the reference answer."
An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. Can the employer rely on a bias audit conducted using test data?,"No, the employer cannot rely on a bias audit conducted using test data. According to § 5-303, an employer may rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other employers or employment agencies, but not on a bias audit conducted using test data.","Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit. The vendor provides historical data regarding 
applicant selection that the vendor has collected from multiple employers to an independent auditor who 
will conduct a bias audit as follows:

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'rule_conclusion', 'seed_document_id': 11, 'topic': 'Metrics/Data', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","No, the employer cannot rely on a bias audit conducted using test data. According to the given context, an employer may rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its own historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other employers or employment agencies.

these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'rule_conclusion', 'seed_document_id': 13, 'topic': 'Metrics/Data', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","According to Section 5-302(b) of the administrative code of the city of New York, an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.

An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for 'culture fit.' The AEDT conducted a bias audit that excluded a category representing less than 2% of the data used. Is this exclusion allowed under the law?,"No, the exclusion of a category that represents less than 2% of the data used for the bias audit is not allowed under the law. The law requires that all categories be included in the calculations for impact ratio, regardless of their representation in the data.","Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT.

Document 0: Subchapter 25: Automated Employment Decision Tools
§ 20-870 Definitions.
For the purposes of this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings:
   Automated employment decision tool. The term ""automated employment decision tool"" means any computational process, derived from machine
learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence, that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation,
that is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons. The term
""automated employment decision tool"" does not include a tool that does not automate, support, substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-
making processes and that does not materially impact natural persons, including, but not limited to, a junk email filter, firewall, antivirus software,
calculator, spreadsheet, database, data set, or other compilation of data.
   Bias audit. The term ""bias audit"" means an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor. Such bias audit shall include but not be limited to the
testing of an automated employment decision tool to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported
by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of
federal regulations.

"An employer is using an AEDT to screen candidates for a job position. The AEDT assesses candidates based on 'culture fit.' According to the provided context, what are the requirements for conducting a bias audit of the AEDT?","The requirements for conducting a bias audit of the AEDT include calculating the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category, comparing the selection rates to the most selected category to determine an impact ratio, and reporting the results to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) as required by the EEO Component 1 report.

iii. 
at any point during the bias audit, has a direct financial interest or a material indirect 
financial interest in an employer or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to 
use the  AEDT or in a vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT. 
 
Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.  
 
 
 
    _________selection rate for a category________

OR 
 
  
 
     ______scoring rate for a category__________  
Impact Ratio =        scoring rate of the highest scoring category 
 
 
Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;",[],"{'question_type': 'rule_conclusion', 'seed_document_id': 9, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","If an employer is using an AEDT to select candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to move forward in the hiring process or classify them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum:

3. Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race.
4. Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) are performed for each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion into specified groups.
5. Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required calculations because they fall within an unknown category.

An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. Can the employer rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT?,"Yes, the employer can rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other employers or employment agencies.","Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

""automated employment decision tool"" does not include a tool that does not automate, support, substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-
making processes and that does not materially impact natural persons, including, but not limited to, a junk email filter, firewall, antivirus software,
calculator, spreadsheet, database, data set, or other compilation of data.
   Bias audit. The term ""bias audit"" means an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor. Such bias audit shall include but not be limited to the
testing of an automated employment decision tool to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported
by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of
federal regulations.

(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and

category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'rule_conclusion', 'seed_document_id': 15, 'topic': 'Metrics/Data', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}",The employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.,True,,1.0,0.8257294297218323,5.0,The generated answer is completely correct and directly addresses all components of the user query without any errors.
An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job posting. What are the requirements for a bias audit of the AEDT?,"For an AEDT that selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion, a bias audit must calculate the selection rate and impact ratio for each category, including sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories. The bias audit must also indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT that are not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category.","Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Document 6: 2 
 
 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope;

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and

calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.

New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection 
 
Notice of Adoption of Final Rule 
 
Pursuant to the authority vested in the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection by 
Sections 1043 and 2203(f) of the New York City Charter and Section 20-104(b) of the New York City 
Administrative Code, and in accordance with the requirements of Section 1043 of the New York City Charter, 
the Department amends Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York.  
 
An initial version of this rule was proposed and published on September 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on 
November 4, 2022, and comments regarding the rule were received. DCWP proposed a second version of this 
rule on December 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on January 23, 2023, and comments regarding the rule 
were received.  
 
Statement of Basis and Purpose 
 
The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP” or “Department”) is adding rules to implement 
new legislation regarding automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”). Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits 
employers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has 
been subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly 
available, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   
 
These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category.

calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.

(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.

category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they

The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the

“Shall” and “must” denote mandatory requirements and may be used interchangeably in the rules of this 
department, unless otherwise specified or unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.

What are the criteria for a bias audit?,"A bias audit of an AEDT must, at a minimum, calculate the selection rate for each category, calculate the impact ratio for each category, ensure that the calculations separately calculate the impact on sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories, and indicate the number of individuals not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category.","Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Document 6: 2 
 
 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.

ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.",[],"{'question_type': 'vague', 'seed_document_id': 5, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","According to the provided context, the criteria for a bias audit are as follows:

Document 0: Subchapter 25: Automated Employment Decision Tools
§ 20-870 Definitions.
For the purposes of this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings:
   Automated employment decision tool. The term ""automated employment decision tool"" means any computational process, derived from machine
learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence, that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation,
that is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons. The term
""automated employment decision tool"" does not include a tool that does not automate, support, substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-
making processes and that does not materially impact natural persons, including, but not limited to, a junk email filter, firewall, antivirus software,
calculator, spreadsheet, database, data set, or other compilation of data.
   Bias audit. The term ""bias audit"" means an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor. Such bias audit shall include but not be limited to the
testing of an automated employment decision tool to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported
by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of
federal regulations.
   Employment decision. The term ""employment decision"" means to screen candidates for employment or employees for promotion within the city.

(L.L. 2021/144, 12/11/2021, eff. 1/1/2023)
§ 20-873 Enforcement.
The corporation counsel or such other persons designated by the corporation counsel on behalf of the department may initiate in any court of competent
jurisdiction any action or proceeding that may be appropriate or necessary for correction of any violation issued pursuant this subchapter, including
mandating compliance with the provisions of this chapter or such other relief as may be appropriate.

This can include relying solely on a simplified output (such as a score or ranking) with no other factors considered, using a simplified output as the most heavily weighted criterion in a set of criteria, or using a simplified output to overrule conclusions derived from other factors, including human decision-making.",False,"The agent's answer provides a definition that is somewhat accurate but lacks the emphasis on machine learning, statistical modeling, and data analytics, which are key components of the ground truth definition.",1.0,0.8053766489028931,4.0,"The generated answer is mostly correct and addresses the main components of the user query, but it introduces some unnecessary complexity and slightly misrepresents the role of the simplified output in the decision-making process."
What are the criteria for an AEDT bias audit?,"A bias audit of an AEDT must, at a minimum, calculate the selection rate for each category, calculate the impact ratio for each category, ensure separate calculations for sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories, perform calculations for each group if applicable, and indicate the number of individuals not included in the calculations due to an unknown category.","Document 14: Data 
on those individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
(c) Where an AEDT scores candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion, a bias 
audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the median score for the full sample of applicants;  
(2) Calculate the scoring rate for individuals in each category;

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;",[],"{'question_type': 'vague', 'seed_document_id': 14, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","According to the legal document, a bias audit of an AEDT must use historical data of the AEDT, and the historical data used may be from one or more employers or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. Additionally, an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. The bias audit must calculate the median score for the full sample of applicants, calculate the scoring rate for individuals in each category, calculate the impact ratio for each category, and indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required calculations because they fall within an unknown category.

What is the meaning of 'selection rate'?,'Selection rate' means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. It can be calculated by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.,"Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test

What are the required calculations?,"The calculations required in the bias audit for the impact ratio include separately calculating the impact of the AEDT on sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race.","Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American

(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 16: (d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'vague', 'seed_document_id': 15, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","According to the information provided, the required calculations for a bias audit of an AEDT (Automated Employment Decision Tool) are:

1. Calculate the median score for the full sample of applicants.
2. Calculate the scoring rate for individuals in each category.
3. Calculate the impact ratio for each category.
4. Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on:
   i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates).
   ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates).

at any point during the bias audit, has a direct financial interest or a material indirect 
financial interest in an employer or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to 
use the  AEDT or in a vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT. 
 
Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.  
 
 
 
    _________selection rate for a category________  
Impact Ratio =        selection rate of the most selected category  
 
OR 
 
  
 
     ______scoring rate for a category__________  
Impact Ratio =        scoring rate of the highest scoring category 
 
 
Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;",[],"{'question_type': 'vague', 'seed_document_id': 9, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","According to the New York City law, before the use of an automated employment decision tool (AEDT), an employer or employment agency must make the following publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.","[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'I would like to know the purpose of conducting a bias audit with the AEDT.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'How can I help you with that?'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'What is its purpose?'}]","{'question_type': 'conversational', 'seed_document_id': 13, 'topic': 'Definitions', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","The purpose of conducting a bias audit with the AEDT (Automated Employment Decision Tool) is to identify and mitigate any potential biases that may exist in the tool's algorithms or data sets. This is important because AEDTs can be used to make important employment decisions, such as screening resumes and scheduling interviews, and if they are biased, they can unfairly disadvantage certain candidates or perpetuate existing inequalities in the workforce. By conducting a bias audit, employers can ensure that their AEDTs are fair and unbiased, and that they are making employment decisions based on merit and qualifications rather than on factors such as race, gender, or other protected characteristics.",False,The agent answer discusses the purpose of conducting a bias audit with the AEDT but does not accurately describe what the AEDT is or its specific purpose related to assessing historical data and collecting demographic information.,0.3333333333333333,0.5387485027313232,3.0,"The generated answer provides a relevant explanation of the purpose of conducting a bias audit but incorrectly defines AEDT as ""Automated Employment Decision Tool"" instead of ""Applicant Employment Data Template,"" leading to a minor factual error."
What is the objective?,"The purpose of a bias audit for an AEDT is to calculate the selection rate and impact ratio for different categories, such as sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectional categories. It also ensures that the calculations are performed for each group if the AEDT classifies candidates into specified groups.","Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.","[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'I need to know the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'How can I help you with that?'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'What are they?'}]","{'question_type': 'conversational', 'seed_document_id': 5, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","According to Section 20-871(a) of the administrative code of the city of New York, it is unlawful for an employer or an employment agency to use an automated employment decision tool to screen a candidate or employee for an employment decision unless:

What is it called?,'Test data' refers to data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.,"Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately

i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino

iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required

§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.","[{'role': 'user', 'content': ""I would like to know the definition of 'test data' in the context of a bias audit.""}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'How can I help you with that?'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'What is it called?'}]","{'question_type': 'conversational', 'seed_document_id': 18, 'topic': 'Definitions', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","I'm sorry, I misunderstood your question earlier. In the context of a bias audit, the term ""test data"" generally refers to a set of data that is used to evaluate the performance of an automated employment decision tool (AEDT) in terms of its potential for bias or discrimination. This test data is typically designed to represent a diverse range of candidates or employees, and may include information such as demographic data, job qualifications, and other relevant factors. The results of the bias audit are then used to identify any potential biases or disparities in the AEDT's decision-making process, and to develop strategies for addressing these issues.",False,"The agent's answer provides an elaborate explanation of 'test data' in the context of a bias audit, but it does not directly address the ground truth definition, which emphasizes that 'test data' is specifically data used for a bias audit that is not historical data.",0.25,0.4761996865272522,3.0,"The generated answer provides a relevant explanation of ""test data"" in the context of a bias audit but does not directly answer the user's query, which simply asks ""What is it called?"""

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.","[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'I need to know the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'How can I help you with that?'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'What are they?'}]","{'question_type': 'conversational', 'seed_document_id': 5, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","According to the text of Local Law 144 of 2021, which amends the administrative code of the city of New York, the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT are:

What is the definition?,'Test data' refers to data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.,"Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not

Section 1.  Chapter 5 of Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York is amended to add Subchapter T to read 
as follows: 
Subchapter T: Automated Employment Decision Tools 
§ 5-300. Definitions. 
As used in this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings: 
 
Automated Employment Decision Tool. “Automated employment decision tool” or “AEDT” means 
“Automated employment decision tool” as defined by § 20-870 of the Code where the phrase “to 
substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making” means: 
i. 
to rely solely on a simplified output (score, tag, classification, ranking, etc.), with no other 
factors considered; or 
ii. 
 to use a simplified output as one of a set of criteria where the simplified output is weighted 
more than any other criterion in the set; or   
iii. 
to use a simplified output to overrule conclusions derived from other factors including 
human decision-making.  
  
Bias Audit. “Bias audit” means “Bias audit” as defined by § 20-870 of the Code.  
 
Candidate for Employment. “Candidate for employment” means a person who has applied for a specific 
employment position by submitting the necessary information or items in the format required by the 
employer or employment agency.  
 
Category. “Category” means any component 1 category required to be reported by employers pursuant 
to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States Code as specified in part 1602.7 of 
title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, as designated on the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission Employer Information Report EEO-1. 
 
Code. “Code” means the Administrative Code of the City of New York. 
 
Distribution Date. “Distribution date” means the date the employer or employment agency began using 
a specific AEDT.  
 
Employment Decision. “Employment decision” means “Employment decision” as defined by § 20-870 
of the Code. 
 
Employment Agency. “Employment agency” means “Employment agency” as defined by 6 RCNY § 5-
249.

It can rely solely on a simplified output (such as a score or ranking) with no other factors considered, or use a simplified output as one of a set of criteria where the simplified output is weighted more than any other criterion in the set, or use a simplified output to overrule conclusions derived from other factors including human decision-making.",False,"The agent's answer provides a definition of an automated employment decision tool but lacks key elements from the ground truth, such as the mention of machine learning, statistical modeling, and the impact on natural persons.",1.0,0.4270240068435669,3.0,The generated answer partially captures the meaning of an automated employment decision tool but includes some inaccuracies regarding its reliance on simplified outputs and does not fully align with the reference answer.
What should be included?,"The summary of results of a bias audit should include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios for all categories.","Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

4. The number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required calculations because they fall within an unknown category.
5. Justification for any exclusion of a category that represents less than 2% of the data being used for the bias audit, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded category.

What is the meaning of it?,'Test data' refers to data used in a bias audit that is not historical data.,"Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers

The audit is conducted by an independent auditor who assesses the tool's performance and identifies any potential biases that may impact the tool's ability to make fair and objective employment decisions. The goal of the audit is to ensure that the tool is not discriminating against any protected groups and that it is making employment decisions based on relevant and non-discriminatory factors. The audit is required under the New York City Administrative Code for employers and employment agencies that use automated employment decision tools.,False,The agent's answer provides a general overview of the purpose of a bias audit but does not specifically address the legal requirements and components outlined in the ground truth answer.,0.4,0.4716189503669739,4.0,"The generated answer correctly addresses the purpose of a bias audit for automated employment decision tools and provides relevant details, but it lacks specific reference to the legal framework mentioned in the reference answer."
What are the necessary details?,"A bias audit of an AEDT must, at a minimum, calculate the selection rate for each category, calculate the impact ratio for each category, separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories, and indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT that are not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category.","Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Document 6: 2 
 
 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.","[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'I need to know the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'How can I help you with that?'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'What are the necessary details?'}]","{'question_type': 'conversational', 'seed_document_id': 5, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","According to the text of Local Law 144 of 2021, the bias audit of an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT) must, at a minimum, include the following:

Additionally, the bias audit must be conducted no more than one year prior to the use of the AEDT, and a summary of the results of the most recent bias audit of the tool, as well as the distribution date of the tool to which such audit applies, must be made publicly available on the website of the employer or employment agency prior to the use of such tool.",False,"The agent's answer provides details about a bias audit of an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT), but it does not match the necessary details outlined in the ground truth, which specifies different calculations and requirements.",1.0,0.5033841729164124,2.0,The generated answer includes some relevant information about the bias audit of an AEDT but contains significant inaccuracies and does not fully address the necessary details as outlined in the reference answer.
What is the definition?,Bias audit means an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor. Such bias audit shall include but not be limited to the testing of an automated employment decision tool to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of federal regulations.,"Document 7: 3

New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection 
 
Notice of Adoption of Final Rule 
 
Pursuant to the authority vested in the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection by 
Sections 1043 and 2203(f) of the New York City Charter and Section 20-104(b) of the New York City 
Administrative Code, and in accordance with the requirements of Section 1043 of the New York City Charter, 
the Department amends Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York.  
 
An initial version of this rule was proposed and published on September 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on 
November 4, 2022, and comments regarding the rule were received. DCWP proposed a second version of this 
rule on December 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on January 23, 2023, and comments regarding the rule 
were received.  
 
Statement of Basis and Purpose 
 
The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP” or “Department”) is adding rules to implement 
new legislation regarding automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”). Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits 
employers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has 
been subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly 
available, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   
 
These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

   Automated employment decision tool. The term ""automated employment decision tool"" means any computational process, derived from machine
learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence, that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation,
that is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons. The term
""automated employment decision tool"" does not include a tool that does not automate, support, substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-
making processes and that does not materially impact natural persons, including, but not limited to, a junk email filter, firewall, antivirus software,
calculator, spreadsheet, database, data set, or other compilation of data.
   Bias audit. The term ""bias audit"" means an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor. Such bias audit shall include but not be limited to the
testing of an automated employment decision tool to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported
by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of
federal regulations.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor's justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.",[],"{'question_type': 'out of scope', 'seed_document_id': 17, 'topic': 'Definitions', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': 'The AEDT is a software developed by a team of engineers.'}",The provided context information does not contain any specific names of individuals or organizations who developed the AEDT software.,True,,1.0,0.0,4.0,"The generated answer correctly states that no specific names are provided, but it could be slightly more concise and directly aligned with the reference answer."

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;

i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency's data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor's justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency's data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'out of scope', 'seed_document_id': 11, 'topic': 'Enforcement and Penalties', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': 'The bias audit of the AEDT must be conducted by an external third-party company.'}","The text does not provide a specific name for the person responsible for conducting the bias audit of the AEDT. It only mentions that an ""independent auditor"" should conduct the audit.",True,The agent correctly states that the text does not provide a specific name and indicates the lack of sufficient information to answer the question.,1.0,0.0,3.0,"The generated answer correctly identifies that the specific name is not provided, but it does not fully address the user's query about the responsible person."

at any point during the bias audit, has a direct financial interest or a material indirect 
financial interest in an employer or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to 
use the  AEDT or in a vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT. 
 
Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.  
 
 
 
    _________selection rate for a category________  
Impact Ratio =        selection rate of the most selected category  
 
OR 
 
  
 
     ______scoring rate for a category__________  
Impact Ratio =        scoring rate of the highest scoring category 
 
 
Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate's fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample's median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor's justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample's median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate's estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate's resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor's justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.

§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'out of scope', 'seed_document_id': 13, 'topic': 'Metrics/Data', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': 'The average age of the male applicants in the White category is 35.'}","There is no information provided in the context about the age of the applicants.

the sample's median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate's estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate's resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the

i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate's fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency's data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;",[],"{'question_type': 'out of scope', 'seed_document_id': 12, 'topic': 'Metrics/Data', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': 'The impact ratio for female applicants is 0.950.'}","There is no information provided in the context about the impact ratio for non-binary applicants.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency's data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;",[],"{'question_type': 'out of scope', 'seed_document_id': 12, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': 'The vendor provides historical data regarding applicant salary.'}","I'm sorry, but there is no information provided in the context about the vendor providing data regarding applicant selection in Venezuela.
