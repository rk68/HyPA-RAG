Cybersecurity protection related to systemic risks associated with malicious use or 
attacks should duly consider accidental model leakage, unauthorised releases, 
circumvention of safety measures, and defence against cyberattacks, unauthorised 
access or model theft. That protection could be facilitated by securing model weights,

In order to introduce a proportionate and effective set of binding rules for AI systems, a 
clearly defined risk-based approach should be followed. That approach should tailor the 
type and content of such rules to the intensity and scope of the risks that AI systems can 
generate. It is therefore necessary to prohibit certain unacceptable AI practices, to lay 
down requirements for high-risk AI systems and obligations for the relevant operators, and 
to lay down transparency obligations for certain AI systems.

and environmental well-being and accountability. Without prejudice to the legally 
binding requirements of this Regulation and any other applicable Union law, those 
guidelines contribute to the design of coherent, trustworthy and human-centric AI, in 
line with the Charter and with the values on which the Union is founded. According to 
the guidelines of the AI HLEG, human agency and oversight means that AI systems are

High-risk AI systems should only be placed on the Union market, put into service or used 
if they comply with certain mandatory requirements. Those requirements should ensure 
that high-risk AI systems available in the Union or whose output is otherwise used in the 
Union do not pose unacceptable risks to important Union public interests as recognised and 
protected by Union law. On the basis of the New Legislative Framework, as clarified in 
the Commission notice “The ‘Blue Guide’ on the implementation of EU product rules 
2022”20, the general rule is that more than one legal act of Union harmonisation 
legislation, such as Regulations (EU) 2017/74521 and (EU) 2017/74622 of the European 
Parliament and of the Council or Directive 2006/42/EC of the European Parliament and 
of the Council23, may be applicable to one product, since the making available or putting 
into service can take place only when the product complies with all applicable Union 
harmonisation legislation. To ensure consistency and avoid unnecessary administrative 
burdens or costs, providers of a product that contains one or more high-risk AI systems, 
to which the requirements of this Regulation and of the Union harmonisation legislation 
listed in an annex to this Regulation apply, should have flexibility with regard to 
operational decisions on how to ensure compliance of a product that contains one or 
more AI systems with all applicable requirements of the Union harmonisation legislation 
in an optimal manner. AI systems identified as high-risk should be limited to those that 
have a significant harmful impact on the health, safety and fundamental rights of persons 
in the Union and such limitation should minimise any potential restriction to international 
trade.

High-risk AI systems should only be placed on the Union market, put into service or used 
if they comply with certain mandatory requirements. Those requirements should ensure 
that high-risk AI systems available in the Union or whose output is otherwise used in the 
Union do not pose unacceptable risks to important Union public interests as recognised and 
protected by Union law. On the basis of the New Legislative Framework, as clarified in 
the Commission notice “The ‘Blue Guide’ on the implementation of EU product rules 
2022”20, the general rule is that more than one legal act of Union harmonisation 
legislation, such as Regulations (EU) 2017/74521 and (EU) 2017/74622 of the European 
Parliament and of the Council or Directive 2006/42/EC of the European Parliament and 
of the Council23, may be applicable to one product, since the making available or putting 
into service can take place only when the product complies with all applicable Union 
harmonisation legislation. To ensure consistency and avoid unnecessary administrative 
burdens or costs, providers of a product that contains one or more high-risk AI systems, 
to which the requirements of this Regulation and of the Union harmonisation legislation 
listed in an annex to this Regulation apply, should have flexibility with regard to 
operational decisions on how to ensure compliance of a product that contains one or 
more AI systems with all applicable requirements of the Union harmonisation legislation 
in an optimal manner. AI systems identified as high-risk should be limited to those that 
have a significant harmful impact on the health, safety and fundamental rights of persons

In light of their digital nature, certain AI systems should fall within the scope of this 
Regulation even when they are not placed on the market, put into service, or used in the 
Union. This is the case, for example, where an operator established in the Union contracts 
certain services to an operator established in a third country in relation to an activity to be 
performed by an AI system that would qualify as high-risk ▌ . In those circumstances, the 
AI system used in a third country by the operator could process data lawfully collected in 
and transferred from the Union, and provide to the contracting operator in the Union the 
output of that AI system resulting from that processing, without that AI system being 
placed on the market, put into service or used in the Union. To prevent the circumvention 
of this Regulation and to ensure an effective protection of natural persons located in the

▌ AI systems ▌ can be easily deployed in a large variety of sectors of the economy and 
many parts of society, including across borders, and can easily circulate throughout the 
Union. Certain Member States have already explored the adoption of national rules to 
ensure that AI is trustworthy and safe and is developed and used in accordance with 
fundamental rights obligations. Diverging national rules may lead to the fragmentation of 
the internal market and may decrease legal certainty for operators that develop, import or 
use AI systems. A consistent and high level of protection throughout the Union should 
therefore be ensured in order to achieve trustworthy AI, while divergences hampering the 
free circulation, innovation, deployment and the uptake of AI systems and related 
products and services within the internal market should be prevented by laying down 
uniform obligations for operators and guaranteeing the uniform protection of overriding 
reasons of public interest and of rights of persons throughout the internal market on the

1. **Safety Components of Critical Infrastructure**: 
   - AI systems that are intended to be used as safety components in the management and operation of critical digital infrastructure (e.g., water supply, electricity, road traffic) are classified as high-risk. 
   - These systems are crucial for protecting the physical integrity of critical infrastructure and ensuring the health and safety of individuals. Their failure or malfunction can lead to significant risks, including threats to life and health, as well as disruptions in social and economic activities.

2. **Stand-Alone High-Risk AI Systems**: 
   - These are AI systems that are not safety components of products but still pose a high risk to health, safety, or fundamental rights. Their classification as high-risk depends on their intended purpose and the severity and probability of potential harm.

3. **AI Systems as Safety Components of Products**: 
   - AI systems that are safety components of products (e.g., machinery, medical devices) are also classified as high-risk if the product undergoes a third-party conformity assessment as per relevant Union harmonization legislation.

- **Definition of Safety Components**: Safety components are systems that protect the physical integrity of critical infrastructure or the health and safety of individuals but are not essential for the system's basic functionality. Examples include monitoring systems for water pressure or fire alarms in data centers.
- **Regulatory Framework**: The classification of these AI systems as high-risk is part of a broader regulatory framework aimed at ensuring that AI systems used in critical infrastructure are robust, secure, and capable of minimizing risks associated with their operation.

"What actions should a provider take if their general-purpose AI model is classified as having systemic risks, and how does the Commission determine this designation?","If a provider's general-purpose AI model meets the criteria for systemic risks, they must notify the AI Office within two weeks. The Commission designates a model as having systemic risk based on its capabilities or impact reaching a specific threshold, reflecting a regulatory approach that considers both provider responsibilities and the Commission's evaluative criteria.","Document 113: EN

It is also necessary to clarify a procedure for the classification of a general-purpose AI 
model with systemic risks. A general-purpose AI model that meets the applicable 
threshold for high-impact capabilities should be presumed to be a general-purpose AI 
models with systemic risk. The provider should notify the AI Office at the latest two 
weeks after the requirements are met or it becomes known that a general-purpose AI 
model will meet the requirements that lead to the presumption. This is especially relevant 
in relation to the threshold of floating point operations because training of general-
purpose AI models takes considerable planning which includes the upfront allocation of 
compute resources and, therefore, providers of general-purpose AI models are able to 
know if their model would meet the threshold before the training is completed. In the 
context of that notification, the provider should be able to demonstrate that, because of 
its specific characteristics, a general-purpose AI model exceptionally does not present 
systemic risks, and that it thus should not be classified as a general-purpose AI model 
with systemic risks. That information is valuable for the AI Office to anticipate the 
placing on the market of general-purpose AI models with systemic risks and the 
providers can start to engage with the AI Office early on. That information is especially 
important with regard to general-purpose AI models that are planned to be released as 
open-source, given that, after the open-source model release, necessary measures to 
ensure compliance with the obligations under this Regulation may be more difficult to 
implement.

It is appropriate to establish a methodology for the classification of general-purpose AI 
models as general-purpose AI model with systemic risks. Since systemic risks result from 
particularly high capabilities, a general-purpose AI model should be considered to 
present systemic risks if it has high-impact capabilities, evaluated on the basis of 
appropriate technical tools and methodologies, or significant impact on the internal 
market due to its reach. High-impact capabilities in general-purpose AI models means 
capabilities that match or exceed the capabilities recorded in the most advanced general-
purpose AI models. The full range of capabilities in a model could be better understood 
after its placing on the market or when deployers interact with the model. According to 
the state of the art at the time of entry into force of this Regulation, the cumulative 
amount of computation used for the training of the general-purpose AI model measured 
in floating point operations is one of the relevant approximations for model capabilities. 
The cumulative amount of computation used for training includes the computation used 
across the activities and methods that are intended to enhance the capabilities of the 
model prior to deployment, such as pre-training, synthetic data generation and fine-
tuning. Therefore, an initial threshold of floating point operations should be set, which, 
if met by a general-purpose AI model, leads to a presumption that the model is a 
general-purpose AI model with systemic risks. This threshold should be adjusted over 
time to reflect technological and industrial changes, such as algorithmic improvements 
or increased hardware efficiency, and should be supplemented with benchmarks and 
indicators for model capability.

Document 112: EN
United in diversity
EN
To inform this, the AI Office should engage with the scientific community, industry, civil 
society and other experts. Thresholds, as well as tools and benchmarks for the 
assessment of high-impact capabilities, should be strong predictors of generality, its 
capabilities and associated systemic risk of general-purpose AI models, and could take 
into account the way the model will be placed on the market or the number of users it 
may affect. To complement this system, there should be a possibility for the Commission 
to take individual decisions designating a general-purpose AI model as a general-
purpose AI model with systemic risk if it is found that such model has capabilities or an 
impact equivalent to those captured by the set threshold. That decision should be taken 
on the basis of an overall assessment of the criteria for the designation of a general-
purpose AI model with systemic risk set out in an annex to this Regulation, such as 
quality or size of the training data set, number of business and end users, its input and 
output modalities, its level of autonomy and scalability, or the tools it has access to. 
Upon a reasoned request of a provider whose model has been designated as a general-
purpose AI model with systemic risk, the Commission should take the request into 
account and may decide to reassess whether the general-purpose AI model can still be 
considered to present systemic risks.

### Obligations of Providers:
1. **Model Evaluation**: Providers must perform model evaluations according to standardized protocols and tools that reflect the state of the art. This includes:
   - Conducting and documenting adversarial testing to identify and mitigate systemic risks.
2. **Risk Assessment and Mitigation**: Providers are required to assess and mitigate possible systemic risks at the Union level, including identifying sources of risk stemming from the development, market placement, or use of the AI models.

   - Cooperating with relevant actors along the AI value chain.
4. **Notification to AI Office**: Providers must notify the AI Office if their model meets the applicable threshold for high-impact capabilities, which may lead to a presumption of systemic risk.

"What are the potential adverse impacts of poorly designed high-risk AI systems used by law enforcement authorities, and how do these systems contribute to these risks?","Poorly designed high-risk AI systems, such as those used for assessing crime victim risk or evaluating evidence reliability, can result in unjust surveillance and discrimination, leading to wrongful arrests or loss of liberty. The inherent risks of these systems are amplified when they are not designed with fairness and accountability in mind, potentially exacerbating issues of bias and injustice in law enforcement.","Document 67: EN

(59)
Given their role and responsibility, actions by law enforcement authorities involving 
certain uses of AI systems are characterised by a significant degree of power imbalance 
and may lead to surveillance, arrest or deprivation of a natural person’s liberty as well as 
other adverse impacts on fundamental rights guaranteed in the Charter. In particular, if the 
AI system is not trained with high-quality data, does not meet adequate requirements in 
terms of its performance, its accuracy or robustness, or is not properly designed and tested 
before being put on the market or otherwise put into service, it may single out people in a 
discriminatory or otherwise incorrect or unjust manner. Furthermore, the exercise of 
important procedural fundamental rights, such as the right to an effective remedy and to a 
fair trial as well as the right of defence and the presumption of innocence, could be 
hampered, in particular, where such AI systems are not sufficiently transparent, 
explainable and documented. It is therefore appropriate to classify as high-risk, insofar as 
their use is permitted under relevant Union and national law, a number of AI systems 
intended to be used in the law enforcement context where accuracy, reliability and 
transparency is particularly important to avoid adverse impacts, retain public trust and 
ensure accountability and effective redress.

In view of the nature of the activities and the risks relating thereto, those high-risk AI 
systems should include in particular AI systems intended to be used by or on behalf of law 
enforcement authorities or by Union institutions, bodies, offices, or agencies in support of 
law enforcement authorities for assessing the risk of a natural person to become a victim 
of criminal offences, as polygraphs and similar tools, for the evaluation of the reliability 
of evidence in in the course of investigation or prosecution of criminal offences, and, 
insofar as not prohibited under this Regulation, for assessing the risk of a natural 
person offending or reoffending not solely on the basis of the profiling of natural persons 
or the assessment of personality traits and characteristics or the past criminal behaviour of 
natural persons or groups, for profiling in the course of detection, investigation or 
prosecution of criminal offences ▌ . AI systems specifically intended to be used for 
administrative proceedings by tax and customs authorities as well as by financial 
intelligence units carrying out administrative tasks analysing information pursuant to 
Union anti-money laundering law should not be classified as high-risk AI systems used

prosecution of criminal offences. The use of AI tools by law enforcement and other 
relevant authorities should not become a factor of inequality, or exclusion. The impact

2. **Inaccuracy and Unreliability**: AI systems that lack adequate performance, accuracy, or robustness can lead to incorrect assessments or predictions, resulting in wrongful arrests or misidentification of suspects.

3. **Erosion of Fundamental Rights**: The use of such AI systems can impede fundamental rights, including the right to a fair trial, the right to an effective remedy, and the presumption of innocence. This can occur if decisions are made based solely on AI outputs without human oversight.

4. **Lack of Transparency**: If AI systems are not sufficiently transparent or explainable, individuals affected by these systems may struggle to understand how decisions are made, making it difficult to challenge or appeal those decisions in court.

The EES is designed to:
1. **Register Entry and Exit Data**: It records the entry and exit of third-country nationals crossing the external borders of EU Member States.
2. **Refusal of Entry Data**: It also logs instances where entry is refused to third-country nationals.
3. **Facilitate Border Control**: By maintaining accurate records, the EES aids border authorities in monitoring and managing the flow of third-country nationals, enhancing security and efficiency at border crossings.

### European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS)
ETIAS aims to:
1. **Pre-Travel Screening**: It requires third-country nationals from visa-exempt countries to apply for travel authorization before entering the Schengen Area.
2. **Risk Assessment**: The system assesses potential security, irregular migration, or health risks posed by applicants, ensuring that individuals who may pose a threat are identified before they arrive at the border.
3. **Streamline Entry Process**: By pre-screening travelers, ETIAS helps to expedite the entry process at borders, reducing wait times and enhancing overall border management.

### Complementary Functions
- **Enhanced Security**: While ETIAS screens travelers before they arrive, the EES tracks their movements once they are in the EU. Together, they create a comprehensive system for monitoring and managing third-country nationals.
- **Data Sharing**: Information from ETIAS can inform border authorities using the EES about potential risks associated with specific travelers, allowing for more informed decision-making at the border.
- **Efficient Border Management**: By combining pre-travel authorization with real-time entry and exit data, both systems work together to improve the efficiency and security of border management, ensuring that the EU can effectively manage migration while upholding security standards.

would be the case if that party puts its name or trademark on a high-risk AI system 
already placed on the market or put into service, without prejudice to contractual 
arrangements stipulating that the obligations are allocated otherwise. This would also be 
the case if that party makes a substantial modification to a high-risk AI system that has

Irrespective of whether an AI system is placed on the market or put into service 
independently of the products referred to in points (a) and (b), that AI system shall be 
considered to be high-risk where both of the following conditions are fulfilled:
(a)
the AI system is intended to be used as a safety component of a product, or the AI 
system is itself a product, covered by the Union harmonisation legislation listed in 
Annex I;
(b)
the product whose safety component pursuant to point (a) is the AI system, or the 
AI system itself as a product, is required to undergo a third-party conformity 
assessment, with a view to the placing on the market or the putting into service of 
that product pursuant to the Union harmonisation legislation listed in Annex I.

High-risk AI systems should only be placed on the Union market, put into service or used 
if they comply with certain mandatory requirements. Those requirements should ensure 
that high-risk AI systems available in the Union or whose output is otherwise used in the 
Union do not pose unacceptable risks to important Union public interests as recognised and 
protected by Union law. On the basis of the New Legislative Framework, as clarified in 
the Commission notice “The ‘Blue Guide’ on the implementation of EU product rules 
2022”20, the general rule is that more than one legal act of Union harmonisation 
legislation, such as Regulations (EU) 2017/74521 and (EU) 2017/74622 of the European 
Parliament and of the Council or Directive 2006/42/EC of the European Parliament and 
of the Council23, may be applicable to one product, since the making available or putting 
into service can take place only when the product complies with all applicable Union 
harmonisation legislation. To ensure consistency and avoid unnecessary administrative 
burdens or costs, providers of a product that contains one or more high-risk AI systems, 
to which the requirements of this Regulation and of the Union harmonisation legislation 
listed in an annex to this Regulation apply, should have flexibility with regard to 
operational decisions on how to ensure compliance of a product that contains one or 
more AI systems with all applicable requirements of the Union harmonisation legislation 
in an optimal manner. AI systems identified as high-risk should be limited to those that 
have a significant harmful impact on the health, safety and fundamental rights of persons 
in the Union and such limitation should minimise any potential restriction to international 
trade.

unnecessary costs, providers of a product that contains one or more high-risk AI system, 
to which the requirements of this Regulation and of the Union harmonisation legislation

apply, should have flexibility with regard to operational decisions on how to ensure 
compliance of a product that contains one or more AI systems with all the applicable 
requirements of that Union harmonised legislation in an optimal manner. That 
flexibility could mean, for example a decision by the provider to integrate a part of the 
necessary testing and reporting processes, information and documentation required 
under this Regulation into already existing documentation and procedures required

operational decisions on how to ensure compliance of a product that contains one or 
more AI systems with all applicable requirements of the Union harmonisation legislation

▌ AI systems ▌ can be easily deployed in a large variety of sectors of the economy and 
many parts of society, including across borders, and can easily circulate throughout the 
Union. Certain Member States have already explored the adoption of national rules to 
ensure that AI is trustworthy and safe and is developed and used in accordance with 
fundamental rights obligations. Diverging national rules may lead to the fragmentation of 
the internal market and may decrease legal certainty for operators that develop, import or 
use AI systems. A consistent and high level of protection throughout the Union should 
therefore be ensured in order to achieve trustworthy AI, while divergences hampering the 
free circulation, innovation, deployment and the uptake of AI systems and related 
products and services within the internal market should be prevented by laying down 
uniform obligations for operators and guaranteeing the uniform protection of overriding 
reasons of public interest and of rights of persons throughout the internal market on the 
basis of Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). To 
the extent that this Regulation contains specific rules on the protection of individuals with 
regard to the processing of personal data concerning restrictions of the use of AI systems 
for remote biometric identification for the purpose of law enforcement, of the use of AI 
systems for risk assessments of natural persons for the purpose of law enforcement and 
of the use of AI systems of biometric categorisation for the purpose of law enforcement, it 
is appropriate to base this Regulation, in so far as those specific rules are concerned, on 
Article 16 TFEU. In light of those specific rules and the recourse to Article 16 TFEU, it is 
appropriate to consult the European Data Protection Board.

What should a provider do if their general-purpose AI model meets the threshold for high-impact capabilities?,The provider should notify the AI Office at the latest two weeks after the requirements are met or it becomes known that a general-purpose AI model will meet the requirements that lead to the presumption.,"Document 111: EN
United in diversity
EN
(111)
It is appropriate to establish a methodology for the classification of general-purpose AI 
models as general-purpose AI model with systemic risks. Since systemic risks result from 
particularly high capabilities, a general-purpose AI model should be considered to 
present systemic risks if it has high-impact capabilities, evaluated on the basis of 
appropriate technical tools and methodologies, or significant impact on the internal 
market due to its reach. High-impact capabilities in general-purpose AI models means 
capabilities that match or exceed the capabilities recorded in the most advanced general-
purpose AI models. The full range of capabilities in a model could be better understood 
after its placing on the market or when deployers interact with the model. According to 
the state of the art at the time of entry into force of this Regulation, the cumulative 
amount of computation used for the training of the general-purpose AI model measured 
in floating point operations is one of the relevant approximations for model capabilities. 
The cumulative amount of computation used for training includes the computation used 
across the activities and methods that are intended to enhance the capabilities of the 
model prior to deployment, such as pre-training, synthetic data generation and fine-
tuning. Therefore, an initial threshold of floating point operations should be set, which, 
if met by a general-purpose AI model, leads to a presumption that the model is a 
general-purpose AI model with systemic risks. This threshold should be adjusted over 
time to reflect technological and industrial changes, such as algorithmic improvements 
or increased hardware efficiency, and should be supplemented with benchmarks and 
indicators for model capability.

Document 113: EN
United in diversity
EN
(112)
It is also necessary to clarify a procedure for the classification of a general-purpose AI 
model with systemic risks. A general-purpose AI model that meets the applicable 
threshold for high-impact capabilities should be presumed to be a general-purpose AI 
models with systemic risk. The provider should notify the AI Office at the latest two 
weeks after the requirements are met or it becomes known that a general-purpose AI 
model will meet the requirements that lead to the presumption. This is especially relevant 
in relation to the threshold of floating point operations because training of general-
purpose AI models takes considerable planning which includes the upfront allocation of 
compute resources and, therefore, providers of general-purpose AI models are able to 
know if their model would meet the threshold before the training is completed. In the 
context of that notification, the provider should be able to demonstrate that, because of 
its specific characteristics, a general-purpose AI model exceptionally does not present 
systemic risks, and that it thus should not be classified as a general-purpose AI model 
with systemic risks. That information is valuable for the AI Office to anticipate the 
placing on the market of general-purpose AI models with systemic risks and the 
providers can start to engage with the AI Office early on. That information is especially 
important with regard to general-purpose AI models that are planned to be released as 
open-source, given that, after the open-source model release, necessary measures to 
ensure compliance with the obligations under this Regulation may be more difficult to 
implement.

Document 112: EN
United in diversity
EN
To inform this, the AI Office should engage with the scientific community, industry, civil 
society and other experts. Thresholds, as well as tools and benchmarks for the 
assessment of high-impact capabilities, should be strong predictors of generality, its 
capabilities and associated systemic risk of general-purpose AI models, and could take 
into account the way the model will be placed on the market or the number of users it 
may affect. To complement this system, there should be a possibility for the Commission 
to take individual decisions designating a general-purpose AI model as a general-
purpose AI model with systemic risk if it is found that such model has capabilities or an 
impact equivalent to those captured by the set threshold. That decision should be taken 
on the basis of an overall assessment of the criteria for the designation of a general-
purpose AI model with systemic risk set out in an annex to this Regulation, such as 
quality or size of the training data set, number of business and end users, its input and 
output modalities, its level of autonomy and scalability, or the tools it has access to. 
Upon a reasoned request of a provider whose model has been designated as a general-
purpose AI model with systemic risk, the Commission should take the request into 
account and may decide to reassess whether the general-purpose AI model can still be 
considered to present systemic risks.",[],"{'question_type': 'simple', 'seed_document_id': 111, 'topic': 'Systemic Risks in AI'}","If a provider's general-purpose AI model meets the threshold for high-impact capabilities, they must notify the Commission without delay and within two weeks of meeting the requirement.

In assessing the risk level of the AI system, both rights would be critically important. However, the specific context of the violation—especially considering the sensitivity of children's data—might lead to a prioritization of the right to privacy in this instance. The rationale would be that protecting the privacy of children is paramount, given their vulnerability and the potential long-term consequences of privacy violations.

That said, the right to an effective remedy would still be essential, as it ensures that individuals can seek justice and accountability for the violation. The EU regulatory framework aims to balance these rights, ensuring that while privacy is protected, mechanisms for redress are also in place.

key functional characteristics of a general-purpose AI model, in particular the generality 
and the capability to competently perform a wide range of distinct tasks. These models 
are typically trained on large amounts of data, through various methods, such as self-
supervised, unsupervised or reinforcement learning. General-purpose AI models may be 
placed on the market in various ways, including through libraries, application 
programming interfaces (APIs), as direct download, or as physical copy. These models 
may be further modified or fine-tuned into new models. Although AI models are 
essential components of AI systems, they do not constitute AI systems on their own. AI 
models require the addition of further components, such as for example a user interface, 
to become AI systems. AI models are typically integrated into and form part of AI 
systems. This Regulation provides specific rules for general-purpose AI models and for 
general-purpose AI models that pose systemic risks, which should apply also when these

When the provider of a general-purpose AI model integrates an own model into its own 
AI system that is made available on the market or put into service, that model should be 
considered to be placed on the market and, therefore, the obligations in this Regulation 
for models should continue to apply in addition to those for AI systems. The obligations 
laid down for models should in any case not apply when an own model is used for purely 
internal processes that are not essential for providing a product or a service to third 
parties and the rights of natural persons are not affected. Considering their potential 
significantly negative effects, the general-purpose AI models with systemic risk should 
always be subject to the relevant obligations under this Regulation. The definition

appreciably resembles existing persons, objects, places, entities or events and would 
falsely appear to a person to be authentic or truthful (deep fakes), should also clearly 
and distinguishably disclose that the content has been artificially created or manipulated 
by labelling the AI output accordingly and disclosing its artificial origin. Compliance 
with this transparency obligation should not be interpreted as indicating that the use of 
the AI system or its output impedes the right to freedom of expression and the right to 
freedom of the arts and sciences guaranteed in the Charter, in particular where the 
content is part of an evidently creative, satirical, artistic, fictional or analogous work or 
programme, subject to appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of third 
parties. In those cases, the transparency obligation for deep fakes set out in this 
Regulation is limited to disclosure of the existence of such generated or manipulated 
content in an appropriate manner that does not hamper the display or enjoyment of the 
work, including its normal exploitation and use, while maintaining the utility and 
quality of the work. In addition, it is also appropriate to envisage a similar disclosure 
obligation in relation to AI-generated or manipulated text to the extent it is published 
with the purpose of informing the public on matters of public interest unless the AI-
generated content has undergone a process of human review or editorial control and a 
natural or legal person holds editorial responsibility for the publication of the content.",[],"{'question_type': 'rule_conclusion', 'seed_document_id': 296, 'topic': 'AI Regulation in the EU'}","In the context of the EU AI Act, if a filmmaker uses an AI system to create a deep fake of a historical figure for a satirical film, the filmmaker is required to disclose that the content has been artificially generated or manipulated.

(97)
The notion of general-purpose AI models should be clearly defined and set apart from 
the notion of AI systems to enable legal certainty. The definition should be based on the 
key functional characteristics of a general-purpose AI model, in particular the generality 
and the capability to competently perform a wide range of distinct tasks. These models 
are typically trained on large amounts of data, through various methods, such as self-
supervised, unsupervised or reinforcement learning. General-purpose AI models may be 
placed on the market in various ways, including through libraries, application 
programming interfaces (APIs), as direct download, or as physical copy. These models 
may be further modified or fine-tuned into new models. Although AI models are 
essential components of AI systems, they do not constitute AI systems on their own. AI 
models require the addition of further components, such as for example a user interface, 
to become AI systems. AI models are typically integrated into and form part of AI 
systems. This Regulation provides specific rules for general-purpose AI models and for 
general-purpose AI models that pose systemic risks, which should apply also when these 
models are integrated or form part of an AI system. It should be understood that the 
obligations for the providers of general-purpose AI models should apply once the 
general-purpose AI models are placed on the market.

Document 102: EN
United in diversity
EN
When the provider of a general-purpose AI model integrates an own model into its own 
AI system that is made available on the market or put into service, that model should be 
considered to be placed on the market and, therefore, the obligations in this Regulation 
for models should continue to apply in addition to those for AI systems. The obligations 
laid down for models should in any case not apply when an own model is used for purely 
internal processes that are not essential for providing a product or a service to third 
parties and the rights of natural persons are not affected. Considering their potential 
significantly negative effects, the general-purpose AI models with systemic risk should 
always be subject to the relevant obligations under this Regulation. The definition 
should not cover AI models used before their placing on the market for the sole purpose 
of research, development and prototyping activities. This is without prejudice to the 
obligation to comply with this Regulation when, following such activities, a model is 
placed on the market.
(98)
Whereas the generality of a model could, inter alia, also be determined by a number of 
parameters, models with at least a billion of parameters and trained with a large amount 
of data using self-supervision at scale should be considered to display significant 
generality and to competently perform a wide range of distinctive tasks.

Procedure
1.
Where a general-purpose AI model meets the condition referred to in Article 51(1), point 
(a), the relevant provider shall notify the Commission without delay and in any event 
within two weeks after that requirement is met or it becomes known that it will be met. 
That notification shall include the information necessary to demonstrate that the

purpose AI model presenting systemic risks of which it has not been notified, it may 
decide to designate it as a model with systemic risk.

2.
The provider of a general-purpose AI model that meets the condition referred to in 
Article 51(1), point (a), may present, with its notification, sufficiently substantiated 
arguments to demonstrate that, exceptionally, although it meets that requirement, the 
general-purpose AI model does not present, due to its specific characteristics, systemic 
risks and therefore should not be classified as a general-purpose AI model with systemic 
risk.
3.
Where the Commission concludes that the arguments submitted pursuant to paragraph 2 
are not sufficiently substantiated and the relevant provider was not able to demonstrate 
that the general-purpose AI model does not present, due to its specific characteristics, 
systemic risks, it shall reject those arguments, and the general-purpose AI model shall be 
considered to be a general-purpose AI model with systemic risk.
4.
The Commission may designate a general-purpose AI model as presenting systemic 
risks, ex officio or following a qualified alert from the scientific panel pursuant to 
Article 90(1), point (a), on the basis of criteria set out in Annex XIII. 
The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 97 in 
order to amend Annex XIII by specifying and updating the criteria set out in that Annex.

ANNEX XIII
Criteria for the designation of general-purpose AI models 
with systemic risk referred to in Article 51
For the purpose of determining that a general-purpose AI model has capabilities or an 
impact equivalent to those set out in Article 51(1), point (a), the Commission shall take into 
account the following criteria:
(a)
the number of parameters of the model;
(b)
the quality or size of the data set, for example measured through tokens;
(c)
the amount of computation used for training the model, measured in floating point 
operations or indicated by a combination of other variables such as estimated cost 
of training, estimated time required for the training, or estimated energy 
consumption for the training;
(d)
the input and output modalities of the model, such as text to text (large language 
models), text to image, multi-modality, and the state of the art thresholds for 
determining high-impact capabilities for each modality, and the specific type of 
inputs and outputs (e.g. biological sequences);
(e)
the benchmarks and evaluations of capabilities of the model, including 
considering the number of tasks without additional training, adaptability to learn 
new, distinct tasks, its level of autonomy and scalability, the tools it has access to;
(f)
whether it has a high impact on the internal market due to its reach, which shall 
be presumed when it has been made available to at least 10 000 registered business 
users established in the Union;
(g)
the number of registered end-users.

Document 113: EN
United in diversity
EN
(112)
It is also necessary to clarify a procedure for the classification of a general-purpose AI 
model with systemic risks. A general-purpose AI model that meets the applicable 
threshold for high-impact capabilities should be presumed to be a general-purpose AI 
models with systemic risk. The provider should notify the AI Office at the latest two 
weeks after the requirements are met or it becomes known that a general-purpose AI 
model will meet the requirements that lead to the presumption. This is especially relevant 
in relation to the threshold of floating point operations because training of general-
purpose AI models takes considerable planning which includes the upfront allocation of 
compute resources and, therefore, providers of general-purpose AI models are able to 
know if their model would meet the threshold before the training is completed. In the 
context of that notification, the provider should be able to demonstrate that, because of 
its specific characteristics, a general-purpose AI model exceptionally does not present 
systemic risks, and that it thus should not be classified as a general-purpose AI model 
with systemic risks. That information is valuable for the AI Office to anticipate the 
placing on the market of general-purpose AI models with systemic risks and the 
providers can start to engage with the AI Office early on. That information is especially 
important with regard to general-purpose AI models that are planned to be released as 
open-source, given that, after the open-source model release, necessary measures to 
ensure compliance with the obligations under this Regulation may be more difficult to 
implement.",[],"{'question_type': 'rule_conclusion', 'seed_document_id': 299, 'topic': 'Systemic Risks in AI'}","Under the EU AI Act, if a tech company develops a general-purpose AI model that meets the floating point operations threshold but claims that its unique design prevents systemic risks, the Commission should follow a structured assessment process:

1. **Notification Requirement**: The provider must notify the Commission within two weeks of meeting the threshold, including information to demonstrate compliance.

2. **Substantiation of Claims**: The provider should present sufficiently substantiated arguments to demonstrate that, despite meeting the threshold, the model does not present systemic risks due to its specific characteristics.

3. **Evaluation of Arguments**: The Commission will evaluate the validity of the provider's arguments. If the arguments are deemed insufficiently substantiated, the Commission will reject them, and the model will be classified as one with systemic risks.

4. **Criteria for Assessment**: The Commission will consider various criteria outlined in Annex XIII, such as:
   - The number of parameters of the model.
   - The quality or size of the training data set.
   - The amount of computation used for training.
   - Input and output modalities.
   - Benchmarks and evaluations of capabilities.
   - Impact on the internal market and number of users.

5. **Potential for Reassessment**: If the Commission concludes that the arguments are not sufficiently substantiated, the model will be classified as presenting systemic risks. However, the provider can request a reassessment if they believe the classification is incorrect.

6. **Engagement with Experts**: The Commission may engage with the scientific panel or other experts to gather insights on the model's capabilities and risks.

In summary, the Commission will rigorously assess the provider's claims against established criteria and may require additional evidence or expert input to determine whether the model can be classified as one with systemic risks or not.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed process for assessment but does not directly address the core requirement of determining if the argument is sufficiently substantiated.

2. **Fines and Penalties**: If the provider fails to bring the AI system into compliance within the designated period, they may be subject to fines as stipulated in Article 99 of the Regulation.

3. **Impact on Quality Management System**: Non-compliance may lead to a reassessment of the approved quality management system. The notified body may require the provider to revise and improve their quality management processes to ensure future compliance.

4. **Market Surveillance Authority Involvement**: If the market surveillance authority determines that the AI system was misclassified as non-high-risk to avoid compliance requirements, the provider could face additional fines and scrutiny.

5. **Potential Suspension or Revocation**: Depending on the severity of the non-compliance, the notified body may suspend or revoke the approval of the quality management system, which would prevent the provider from placing their AI systems on the market until compliance is achieved.

Each use of a ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification system in publicly accessible 
spaces for the purpose of law enforcement should be subject to an express and specific 
authorisation by a judicial authority or by an independent administrative authority of a 
Member State whose decision is binding. Such authorisation should, in principle, be 
obtained prior to the use of the AI system with a view to identifying a person or persons. 
Exceptions to that rule should be allowed in duly justified situations on grounds of 
urgency, namely in situations where the need to use the systems concerned is such as to 
make it effectively and objectively impossible to obtain an authorisation before 
commencing the use of the AI system. In such situations of urgency, the use of the AI 
system should be restricted to the absolute minimum necessary and should be subject to 
appropriate safeguards and conditions, as determined in national law and specified in the 
context of each individual urgent use case by the law enforcement authority itself. In 
addition, the law enforcement authority should in such situations request such 
authorisation ▌ while providing the reasons for not having been able to request it earlier, 
without undue delay and at the latest within 24 hours. If such an authorisation is 
rejected, the use of real-time biometric identification systems linked to that authorisation 
should cease with immediate effect and all the data related to such use should be 
discarded and deleted. Such data includes input data directly acquired by an AI system 
in the course of the use of such system as well as the results and outputs of the use 
linked to that authorisation. It should not include input that is legally acquired in 
accordance with another Union or national law. In any case, no decision producing an 
adverse legal effect on a person should be taken based solely on the output of the remote 
biometric identification system.

For the purposes of paragraph 1, first subparagraph, point (h) and paragraph 2, each ▌ use 
for the purposes of law enforcement of a ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification system 
in publicly accessible spaces shall be subject to a prior authorisation granted by a judicial 
authority or ▌ an independent administrative authority whose decision is binding of the 
Member State in which the use is to take place, issued upon a reasoned request and in 
accordance with the detailed rules of national law referred to in paragraph 5. However, in a 
duly justified situation of urgency, the use of such system may be commenced without an 
authorisation provided that such authorisation is requested without undue delay, at the 
latest within 24 hours. If such authorisation is rejected, the use shall be stopped with 
immediate effect and all the data, as well as the results and outputs of that use shall be 
immediately discarded and deleted.
The competent judicial authority or an independent administrative authority whose 
decision is binding shall grant the authorisation only where it is satisfied, on the basis of 
objective evidence or clear indications presented to it, that the use of the ‘real-time’ remote 
biometric identification system concerned is necessary for, and proportionate to, achieving 
one of the objectives specified in paragraph 1, first subparagraph, point (h), as identified in 
the request and, in particular, remains limited to what is strictly necessary concerning 
the period of time as well as the geographic and personal scope. In deciding on the 
request, that authority shall take into account the elements referred to in paragraph 2. No

The use of AI systems for real-time remote biometric identification of natural persons in 
publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement necessarily involves the 
processing of biometric data. The rules of this Regulation that prohibit, subject to certain 
exceptions, such use, which are based on Article 16 TFEU, should apply as lex specialis in 
respect of the rules on the processing of biometric data contained in Article 10 of Directive 
(EU) 2016/680, thus regulating such use and the processing of biometric data involved in 
an exhaustive manner. Therefore, such use and processing should be possible only in as far 
as it is compatible with the framework set by this Regulation, without there being scope, 
outside that framework, for the competent authorities, where they act for purpose of law 
enforcement, to use such systems and process such data in connection thereto on the 
grounds listed in Article 10 of Directive (EU) 2016/680. In that context, this Regulation is 
not intended to provide the legal basis for the processing of personal data under Article 8 
of Directive (EU) 2016/680. However, the use of real-time remote biometric identification 
systems in publicly accessible spaces for purposes other than law enforcement, including 
by competent authorities, should not be covered by the specific framework regarding such 
use for the purpose of law enforcement set by this Regulation. Such use for purposes other 
than law enforcement should therefore not be subject to the requirement of an authorisation 
under this Regulation and the applicable detailed rules of national law that may give effect 
to that authorisation.

The use of AI systems for ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification of natural persons in 
publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement is particularly intrusive to 
the rights and freedoms of the concerned persons, to the extent that it may affect the 
private life of a large part of the population, evoke a feeling of constant surveillance and 
indirectly dissuade the exercise of the freedom of assembly and other fundamental rights. 
Technical inaccuracies of AI systems intended for the remote biometric identification of 
natural persons can lead to biased results and entail discriminatory effects. Such 
possible biased results and discriminatory effects are particularly relevant with regard to 
age, ethnicity, race, sex or disabilities. In addition, the immediacy of the impact and the 
limited opportunities for further checks or corrections in relation to the use of such systems 
operating in real-time carry heightened risks for the rights and freedoms of the persons 
concerned in the context of, or impacted by, law enforcement activities.
(33)
The use of those systems for the purpose of law enforcement should therefore be 
prohibited, except in exhaustively listed and narrowly defined situations, where the use is 
strictly necessary to achieve a substantial public interest, the importance of which 
outweighs the risks. Those situations involve the search for certain victims of crime ▌ 
including missing persons; certain threats to the life or to the physical safety of natural 
persons or of a terrorist attack; and the localisation or identification of perpetrators or 
suspects of the criminal offences listed in an annex to this Regulation, where those 
criminal offences are punishable in the Member State concerned by a custodial sentence or 
a detention order for a maximum period of at least four years and as they are defined in the 
law of that Member State. Such a threshold for the custodial sentence or detention order in 
accordance with national law contributes to ensuring that the offence should be serious 
enough to potentially justify the use of ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification systems.",[],"{'question_type': 'distracting element', 'seed_document_id': 38, 'distracting_context': 'EN\nUnited in diversity\nEN\nArticle 37\nChallenge to the competence of notified bodies\n1.\nThe Commission shall, where necessary, investigate all cases where there are reasons to \ndoubt the competence of a notified body or the continued fulfilment by a notified body of \nthe requirements laid down in Article 31 and of its applicable responsibilities.\n2.\nThe notifying authority shall provide the Commission, on request, with all relevant \ninformation relating to the notification or the maintenance of the competence of the \nnotified body concerned.\n3.\nThe Commission shall ensure that all sensitive information obtained in the course of its \ninvestigations pursuant to this Article is treated confidentially in accordance with \nArticle 78.\n4.\nWhere the Commission ascertains that a notified body does not meet or no longer meets \nthe requirements for its notification, it shall inform the notifying Member State \naccordingly and request it to take the necessary corrective measures, including the \nsuspension or withdrawal of the notification if necessary.

"What specific actions should a provider undertake if their general-purpose AI model meets the threshold for high-impact capabilities, particularly in relation to the information required under Article 49(3) for high-risk AI systems?",The provider should notify the AI Office at the latest two weeks after the requirements are met or it becomes known that a general-purpose AI model will meet the requirements that lead to the presumption.,"Document 111: EN
United in diversity
EN
(111)
It is appropriate to establish a methodology for the classification of general-purpose AI 
models as general-purpose AI model with systemic risks. Since systemic risks result from 
particularly high capabilities, a general-purpose AI model should be considered to 
present systemic risks if it has high-impact capabilities, evaluated on the basis of 
appropriate technical tools and methodologies, or significant impact on the internal 
market due to its reach. High-impact capabilities in general-purpose AI models means 
capabilities that match or exceed the capabilities recorded in the most advanced general-
purpose AI models. The full range of capabilities in a model could be better understood 
after its placing on the market or when deployers interact with the model. According to 
the state of the art at the time of entry into force of this Regulation, the cumulative 
amount of computation used for the training of the general-purpose AI model measured 
in floating point operations is one of the relevant approximations for model capabilities. 
The cumulative amount of computation used for training includes the computation used 
across the activities and methods that are intended to enhance the capabilities of the 
model prior to deployment, such as pre-training, synthetic data generation and fine-
tuning. Therefore, an initial threshold of floating point operations should be set, which, 
if met by a general-purpose AI model, leads to a presumption that the model is a 
general-purpose AI model with systemic risks. This threshold should be adjusted over 
time to reflect technological and industrial changes, such as algorithmic improvements 
or increased hardware efficiency, and should be supplemented with benchmarks and 
indicators for model capability.

Document 113: EN
United in diversity
EN
(112)
It is also necessary to clarify a procedure for the classification of a general-purpose AI 
model with systemic risks. A general-purpose AI model that meets the applicable 
threshold for high-impact capabilities should be presumed to be a general-purpose AI 
models with systemic risk. The provider should notify the AI Office at the latest two 
weeks after the requirements are met or it becomes known that a general-purpose AI 
model will meet the requirements that lead to the presumption. This is especially relevant 
in relation to the threshold of floating point operations because training of general-
purpose AI models takes considerable planning which includes the upfront allocation of 
compute resources and, therefore, providers of general-purpose AI models are able to 
know if their model would meet the threshold before the training is completed. In the 
context of that notification, the provider should be able to demonstrate that, because of 
its specific characteristics, a general-purpose AI model exceptionally does not present 
systemic risks, and that it thus should not be classified as a general-purpose AI model 
with systemic risks. That information is valuable for the AI Office to anticipate the 
placing on the market of general-purpose AI models with systemic risks and the 
providers can start to engage with the AI Office early on. That information is especially 
important with regard to general-purpose AI models that are planned to be released as 
open-source, given that, after the open-source model release, necessary measures to 
ensure compliance with the obligations under this Regulation may be more difficult to 
implement.

Document 112: EN

To inform this, the AI Office should engage with the scientific community, industry, civil 
society and other experts. Thresholds, as well as tools and benchmarks for the 
assessment of high-impact capabilities, should be strong predictors of generality, its 
capabilities and associated systemic risk of general-purpose AI models, and could take 
into account the way the model will be placed on the market or the number of users it 
may affect. To complement this system, there should be a possibility for the Commission 
to take individual decisions designating a general-purpose AI model as a general-
purpose AI model with systemic risk if it is found that such model has capabilities or an 
impact equivalent to those captured by the set threshold. That decision should be taken 
on the basis of an overall assessment of the criteria for the designation of a general-
purpose AI model with systemic risk set out in an annex to this Regulation, such as 
quality or size of the training data set, number of business and end users, its input and 
output modalities, its level of autonomy and scalability, or the tools it has access to. 
Upon a reasoned request of a provider whose model has been designated as a general-
purpose AI model with systemic risk, the Commission should take the request into 
account and may decide to reassess whether the general-purpose AI model can still be 
considered to present systemic risks.",[],"{'question_type': 'distracting element', 'seed_document_id': 111, 'distracting_context': 'EN\nUnited in diversity\nEN\nSection C - Information to be submitted by deployers of high-risk AI systems in accordance with \nArticle 49(3)\nThe following information shall be provided and thereafter kept up to date with regard to high-\nrisk AI systems to be registered in accordance with Article 49:\n1.\nThe name, address and contact details of the deployer;\n2.\nThe name, address and contact details of the person submitting information on behalf of \nthe deployer;\n3.\nThe URL of the entry of the AI system in the EU database by its provider;\n4.\nA summary of the findings of the fundamental rights impact assessment conducted in \naccordance with Article 27;\n5.\nA summary of the data protection impact assessment carried out in accordance with \nArticle 35 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 or Article 27 of Directive (EU) 2016/680 as \nspecified in Article 26(8) of this Regulation, where applicable.', 'topic': 'Systemic Risks in AI'}","If a provider's general-purpose AI model meets the threshold for high-impact capabilities, they should undertake the following specific actions:

The deployment of AI systems in education is important to promote high-quality digital 
education and training and to allow all learners and teachers to acquire and share the 
necessary digital skills and competences, including media literacy, and critical thinking, 
to take an active part in the economy, society, and in democratic processes. However, AI 
systems used in education or vocational training, in particular for determining access or 
admission, for assigning persons to educational and vocational training institutions or 
programmes at all levels, for evaluating learning outcomes of persons, for assessing the 
appropriate level of education for an individual and materially influencing the level of 
education and training that individuals will receive or will be able to access or for 
monitoring and detecting prohibited behaviour of students during tests should be 
classified as high-risk AI systems, since they may determine the educational and 
professional course of a person’s life and therefore may affect that person’s ability to

1. **Impact on Educational Outcomes**: AI systems can significantly influence access to education, admission processes, and the evaluation of learning outcomes. This can determine an individual's educational and professional trajectory, affecting their ability to secure a livelihood.

2. **Potential for Discrimination**: Improperly designed AI systems may perpetuate or exacerbate existing biases, leading to discrimination against certain groups based on gender, age, disability, racial or ethnic origins, or sexual orientation. This raises concerns about the right to non-discrimination and equal access to education.

3. **Intrusiveness and Privacy Concerns**: AI systems that monitor student behavior or assess performance can be intrusive, potentially violating the right to privacy and the right to education. The use of such systems must be carefully managed to protect students' rights.

4. **Fundamental Rights at Stake**: The deployment of AI in education intersects with various fundamental rights, including the right to education, the right to human dignity, and the right to an effective remedy. Any adverse impact on these rights necessitates a high-risk classification.

5. **Need for Transparency and Accountability**: Given the potential for significant consequences, there is a strong need for transparency in how AI systems operate, including their decision-making processes. This is crucial for maintaining public trust and ensuring accountability.

6. **Mitigation of Risks**: The classification as high-risk underscores the importance of rigorous testing and development processes to identify and mitigate risks associated with AI systems. This includes ensuring that systems are trained on high-quality data and are designed to be fair, accurate, and robust.

7. **Regulatory Compliance**: The classification aligns with regulatory frameworks that require high-risk AI systems to undergo stringent assessments to ensure they do not infringe on fundamental rights or lead to harmful outcomes.

In order to efficiently ensure that fundamental rights are protected, deployers of high-
risk AI systems that are bodies governed by public law, or private entities providing 
public services and deployers of certain high-risk AI systems listed in an annex to this 
Regulation, such as banking or insurance entities, should carry out a fundamental 
rights impact assessment prior to putting it into use. Services important for individuals 
that are of public nature may also be provided by private entities. Private entities 
providing such public services are linked to tasks in the public interest such as in the 
areas of education, healthcare, social services, housing, administration of justice. The 
aim of the fundamental rights impact assessment is for the deployer to identify the 
specific risks to the rights of individuals or groups of individuals likely to be affected, 
identify measures to be taken in the case of a materialisation of those risks. The impact 
assessment should be performed prior to deploying the high-risk AI system, and should 
be updated when the deployer considers that any of the relevant factors have changed. 
The impact assessment should identify the deployer’s relevant processes in which the 
high-risk AI system will be used in line with its intended purpose, and should include a 
description of the period of time and frequency in which the system is intended to be 
used as well as of specific categories of natural persons and groups who are likely to be 
affected in the specific context of use.

Document 100: EN
United in diversity

The assessment should also include the identification of specific risks of harm likely to 
have an impact on the fundamental rights of those persons or groups. While performing 
this assessment, the deployer should take into account information relevant to a proper 
assessment of the impact, including but not limited to the information given by the 
provider of the high-risk AI system in the instructions for use. In light of the risks 
identified, deployers should determine measures to be taken in the case of a 
materialisation of those risks, including for example governance arrangements in that 
specific context of use, such as arrangements for human oversight according to the 
instructions of use or, complaint handling and redress procedures, as they could be 
instrumental in mitigating risks to fundamental rights in concrete use-cases. After 
performing that impact assessment, the deployer should notify the relevant market 
surveillance authority. Where appropriate, to collect relevant information necessary to 
perform the impact assessment, deployers of high-risk AI system, in particular when AI 
systems are used in the public sector, could involve relevant stakeholders, including the 
representatives of groups of persons likely to be affected by the AI system, independent 
experts, and civil society organisations in conducting such impact assessments and 
designing measures to be taken in the case of materialisation of the risks. The European 
Artificial Intelligence Office (AI Office) should develop a template for a questionnaire in

Here are the key aspects of its role:

1. **Identification of Risks**: The FRIA requires deployers to identify specific risks of harm that the AI system may pose to individuals or groups, especially vulnerable populations. This includes assessing how the AI system could adversely impact rights such as the right to health, safety, and non-discrimination.

2. **Contextual Analysis**: The assessment involves a detailed description of the processes in which the AI system will be used, the duration and frequency of its use, and the categories of individuals likely to be affected. This contextual understanding is essential for evaluating systemic risks that could arise from the AI's deployment in public health and safety scenarios.

3. **Mitigation Measures**: Based on the identified risks, the FRIA mandates the development of measures to mitigate potential harms. This could include governance arrangements, human oversight, and complaint handling mechanisms, which are vital for addressing issues that may arise during the AI system's operation.

4. **Stakeholder Involvement**: The FRIA encourages the involvement of relevant stakeholders, including affected individuals, independent experts, and civil society organizations. This collaborative approach helps ensure that diverse perspectives are considered, particularly regarding public health and safety implications.

5. **Ongoing Monitoring and Updates**: The FRIA is not a one-time process; it must be updated whenever there are changes in the relevant factors. This ongoing evaluation is critical for adapting to new risks that may emerge as the AI system is used in real-world contexts.

6. **Notification to Authorities**: After conducting the FRIA, deployers are required to notify the relevant market surveillance authority of the results. This transparency is essential for accountability and for ensuring that public health and safety concerns are adequately addressed.

In summary, the FRIA serves as a proactive framework for assessing and managing the risks associated with high-risk AI systems, particularly in contexts where public health and safety are at stake.

The use of AI systems for real-time remote biometric identification of natural persons in 
publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement necessarily involves the 
processing of biometric data. The rules of this Regulation that prohibit, subject to certain 
exceptions, such use, which are based on Article 16 TFEU, should apply as lex specialis in 
respect of the rules on the processing of biometric data contained in Article 10 of Directive 
(EU) 2016/680, thus regulating such use and the processing of biometric data involved in 
an exhaustive manner. Therefore, such use and processing should be possible only in as far 
as it is compatible with the framework set by this Regulation, without there being scope, 
outside that framework, for the competent authorities, where they act for purpose of law 
enforcement, to use such systems and process such data in connection thereto on the

systems in publicly accessible spaces for purposes other than law enforcement, including 
by competent authorities, should not be covered by the specific framework regarding such 
use for the purpose of law enforcement set by this Regulation. Such use for purposes other 
than law enforcement should therefore not be subject to the requirement of an authorisation

the rights and freedoms of the concerned persons, to the extent that it may affect the 
private life of a large part of the population, evoke a feeling of constant surveillance and 
indirectly dissuade the exercise of the freedom of assembly and other fundamental rights. 
Technical inaccuracies of AI systems intended for the remote biometric identification of 
natural persons can lead to biased results and entail discriminatory effects. Such 
possible biased results and discriminatory effects are particularly relevant with regard to 
age, ethnicity, race, sex or disabilities. In addition, the immediacy of the impact and the

General-purpose AI models could pose systemic risks which include, but are not limited 
to, any actual or reasonably foreseeable negative effects in relation to major accidents, 
disruptions of critical sectors and serious consequences to public health and safety; any 
actual or reasonably foreseeable negative effects on democratic processes, public and 
economic security; the dissemination of illegal, false, or discriminatory content. 
Systemic risks should be understood to increase with model capabilities and model 
reach, can arise along the entire lifecycle of the model, and are influenced by conditions 
of misuse, model reliability, model fairness and model security, the level of autonomy of 
the model, its access to tools, novel or combined modalities, release and distribution 
strategies, the potential to remove guardrails and other factors. In particular, 
international approaches have so far identified the need to pay attention to risks from 
potential intentional misuse or unintended issues of control relating to alignment with 
human intent; chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear risks, such as the ways in 
which barriers to entry can be lowered, including for weapons development, design 
acquisition, or use; offensive cyber capabilities, such as the ways in vulnerability 
discovery, exploitation, or operational use can be enabled; the effects of interaction and 
tool use, including for example the capacity to control physical systems and interfere 
with critical infrastructure; risks from models of making copies of themselves or ‘self-
replicating’ or training other models; the ways in which models can give rise to harmful 
bias and discrimination with risks to individuals, communities or societies; the 
facilitation of disinformation or harming privacy with threats to democratic values and 
human rights; risk that a particular event could lead to a chain reaction with 
considerable negative effects that could affect up to an entire city, an entire domain

2. **Public Health and Safety Risks**: AI models that influence healthcare decisions or emergency response systems could pose risks to public health and safety if they provide inaccurate recommendations or predictions.

3. **Democratic Processes**: The dissemination of disinformation or biased content generated by AI models could undermine democratic processes, affecting elections and public opinion.

4. **Economic Security**: AI models could be exploited to manipulate financial markets or disrupt economic stability, leading to significant economic consequences.

5. **Discrimination and Bias**: AI models may perpetuate or exacerbate existing biases, leading to discriminatory outcomes in areas such as hiring, law enforcement, or lending.

6. **Cybersecurity Threats**: The integration of AI models into IT systems could create vulnerabilities that malicious actors could exploit, leading to data breaches or attacks on critical infrastructure.

7. **Self-Replication and Autonomous Behavior**: AI models that can replicate themselves or operate autonomously may lead to unintended consequences, including loss of control over AI systems.

8. **Chain Reactions**: A failure or misuse of an AI model could trigger a chain reaction, resulting in widespread negative effects that impact entire communities or sectors.

9. **Privacy Violations**: AI models that process personal data could lead to privacy infringements, especially if they generate or disseminate sensitive information without consent.

10. **Manipulation of Physical Systems**: AI models with access to control physical systems could interfere with critical infrastructure, leading to safety hazards or operational failures.

Aside from the many beneficial uses of AI, it can also be misused and provide novel and 
powerful tools for manipulative, exploitative and social control practices. Such practices 
are particularly harmful and abusive and should be prohibited because they contradict

AI-enabled manipulative techniques can be used to persuade persons to engage in 
unwanted behaviours, or to deceive them by nudging them into decisions in a way that 
subverts and impairs their autonomy, decision-making and free choices. The placing on 
the market, the putting into service or the use of certain AI systems with the objective to or 
the effect of materially distorting human behaviour, whereby significant harms, in 
particular having sufficiently important adverse impacts on physical, psychological 
health or financial interests are likely to occur, are particularly dangerous and should 
therefore be prohibited. Such AI systems deploy subliminal components such as audio, 
image, video stimuli that persons cannot perceive, as those stimuli are beyond human 
perception, or other manipulative or deceptive techniques that subvert or impair person’s 
autonomy, decision-making or free choice in ways that people are not consciously aware 
of those techniques or, where they are aware of them, can still be deceived or are not 
able to control or resist them. This could be facilitated, for example, by machine-brain 
interfaces or virtual reality as they allow for a higher degree of control of what stimuli 
are presented to persons, insofar as they may materially distort their behaviour in a 
significantly harmful manner. In addition, AI systems may also otherwise exploit the 
vulnerabilities of a person or a specific group of persons due to their age, disability within 
the meaning of Directive (EU) 2019/882 of the European Parliament and of the 
Council16, or a specific social or economic situation that is likely to make those persons

Each use of a ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification system in publicly accessible 
spaces for the purpose of law enforcement should be subject to an express and specific 
authorisation by a judicial authority or by an independent administrative authority of a 
Member State whose decision is binding. Such authorisation should, in principle, be 
obtained prior to the use of the AI system with a view to identifying a person or persons. 
Exceptions to that rule should be allowed in duly justified situations on grounds of 
urgency, namely in situations where the need to use the systems concerned is such as to 
make it effectively and objectively impossible to obtain an authorisation before 
commencing the use of the AI system. In such situations of urgency, the use of the AI 
system should be restricted to the absolute minimum necessary and should be subject to 
appropriate safeguards and conditions, as determined in national law and specified in the 
context of each individual urgent use case by the law enforcement authority itself. In 
addition, the law enforcement authority should in such situations request such 
authorisation ▌ while providing the reasons for not having been able to request it earlier, 
without undue delay and at the latest within 24 hours. If such an authorisation is 
rejected, the use of real-time biometric identification systems linked to that authorisation 
should cease with immediate effect and all the data related to such use should be 
discarded and deleted. Such data includes input data directly acquired by an AI system 
in the course of the use of such system as well as the results and outputs of the use 
linked to that authorisation. It should not include input that is legally acquired in 
accordance with another Union or national law. In any case, no decision producing an 
adverse legal effect on a person should be taken based solely on the output of the remote 
biometric identification system.

authority or ▌ an independent administrative authority whose decision is binding of the 
Member State in which the use is to take place, issued upon a reasoned request and in 
accordance with the detailed rules of national law referred to in paragraph 5. However, in a 
duly justified situation of urgency, the use of such system may be commenced without an 
authorisation provided that such authorisation is requested without undue delay, at the 
latest within 24 hours. If such authorisation is rejected, the use shall be stopped with 
immediate effect and all the data, as well as the results and outputs of that use shall be 
immediately discarded and deleted.
The competent judicial authority or an independent administrative authority whose 
decision is binding shall grant the authorisation only where it is satisfied, on the basis of 
objective evidence or clear indications presented to it, that the use of the ‘real-time’ remote 
biometric identification system concerned is necessary for, and proportionate to, achieving 
one of the objectives specified in paragraph 1, first subparagraph, point (h), as identified in

The use of AI systems for real-time remote biometric identification of natural persons in 
publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement necessarily involves the 
processing of biometric data. The rules of this Regulation that prohibit, subject to certain 
exceptions, such use, which are based on Article 16 TFEU, should apply as lex specialis in 
respect of the rules on the processing of biometric data contained in Article 10 of Directive 
(EU) 2016/680, thus regulating such use and the processing of biometric data involved in 
an exhaustive manner. Therefore, such use and processing should be possible only in as far 
as it is compatible with the framework set by this Regulation, without there being scope, 
outside that framework, for the competent authorities, where they act for purpose of law 
enforcement, to use such systems and process such data in connection thereto on the 
grounds listed in Article 10 of Directive (EU) 2016/680. In that context, this Regulation is 
not intended to provide the legal basis for the processing of personal data under Article 8 
of Directive (EU) 2016/680. However, the use of real-time remote biometric identification 
systems in publicly accessible spaces for purposes other than law enforcement, including 
by competent authorities, should not be covered by the specific framework regarding such 
use for the purpose of law enforcement set by this Regulation. Such use for purposes other 
than law enforcement should therefore not be subject to the requirement of an authorisation 
under this Regulation and the applicable detailed rules of national law that may give effect 
to that authorisation.

The use of AI systems for ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification of natural persons in 
publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement is particularly intrusive to 
the rights and freedoms of the concerned persons, to the extent that it may affect the 
private life of a large part of the population, evoke a feeling of constant surveillance and 
indirectly dissuade the exercise of the freedom of assembly and other fundamental rights. 
Technical inaccuracies of AI systems intended for the remote biometric identification of 
natural persons can lead to biased results and entail discriminatory effects. Such 
possible biased results and discriminatory effects are particularly relevant with regard to 
age, ethnicity, race, sex or disabilities. In addition, the immediacy of the impact and the 
limited opportunities for further checks or corrections in relation to the use of such systems 
operating in real-time carry heightened risks for the rights and freedoms of the persons 
concerned in the context of, or impacted by, law enforcement activities.

The use of those systems for the purpose of law enforcement should therefore be 
prohibited, except in exhaustively listed and narrowly defined situations, where the use is 
strictly necessary to achieve a substantial public interest, the importance of which 
outweighs the risks. Those situations involve the search for certain victims of crime ▌ 
including missing persons; certain threats to the life or to the physical safety of natural 
persons or of a terrorist attack; and the localisation or identification of perpetrators or 
suspects of the criminal offences listed in an annex to this Regulation, where those 
criminal offences are punishable in the Member State concerned by a custodial sentence or 
a detention order for a maximum period of at least four years and as they are defined in the 
law of that Member State. Such a threshold for the custodial sentence or detention order in 
accordance with national law contributes to ensuring that the offence should be serious

harmonisation legislation. To ensure consistency and avoid unnecessary administrative 
burdens or costs, providers of a product that contains one or more high-risk AI systems, 
to which the requirements of this Regulation and of the Union harmonisation legislation 
listed in an annex to this Regulation apply, should have flexibility with regard to 
operational decisions on how to ensure compliance of a product that contains one or 
more AI systems with all applicable requirements of the Union harmonisation legislation

risk AI systems that are bodies governed by public law, or private entities providing 
public services and deployers of certain high-risk AI systems listed in an annex to this 
Regulation, such as banking or insurance entities, should carry out a fundamental 
rights impact assessment prior to putting it into use. Services important for individuals 
that are of public nature may also be provided by private entities. Private entities 
providing such public services are linked to tasks in the public interest such as in the 
areas of education, healthcare, social services, housing, administration of justice. The 
aim of the fundamental rights impact assessment is for the deployer to identify the 
specific risks to the rights of individuals or groups of individuals likely to be affected, 
identify measures to be taken in the case of a materialisation of those risks. The impact 
assessment should be performed prior to deploying the high-risk AI system, and should 
be updated when the deployer considers that any of the relevant factors have changed. 
The impact assessment should identify the deployer’s relevant processes in which the 
high-risk AI system will be used in line with its intended purpose, and should include a

this assessment, the deployer should take into account information relevant to a proper 
assessment of the impact, including but not limited to the information given by the 
provider of the high-risk AI system in the instructions for use. In light of the risks 
identified, deployers should determine measures to be taken in the case of a 
materialisation of those risks, including for example governance arrangements in that 
specific context of use, such as arrangements for human oversight according to the 
instructions of use or, complaint handling and redress procedures, as they could be 
instrumental in mitigating risks to fundamental rights in concrete use-cases. After 
performing that impact assessment, the deployer should notify the relevant market 
surveillance authority. Where appropriate, to collect relevant information necessary to 
perform the impact assessment, deployers of high-risk AI system, in particular when AI 
systems are used in the public sector, could involve relevant stakeholders, including the 
representatives of groups of persons likely to be affected by the AI system, independent 
experts, and civil society organisations in conducting such impact assessments and

Technical robustness is a key requirement for high-risk AI systems. They should be 
resilient in relation to harmful or otherwise undesirable behaviour that may result from 
limitations within the systems or the environment in which the systems operate (e.g. 
errors, faults, inconsistencies, unexpected situations). Therefore, technical and 
organisational measures should be taken to ensure robustness of high-risk AI systems, 
for example by designing and developing appropriate technical solutions to prevent or 
minimize harmful or otherwise undesirable behaviour. Those technical solution may 
include for instance mechanisms enabling the system to safely interrupt its operation 
(fail-safe plans) in the presence of certain anomalies or when operation takes place 
outside certain predetermined boundaries. Failure to protect against these risks could lead 
to safety impacts or negatively affect the fundamental rights, for example due to erroneous 
decisions or wrong or biased outputs generated by the AI system.
(76)
Cybersecurity plays a crucial role in ensuring that AI systems are resilient against attempts 
to alter their use, behaviour, performance or compromise their security properties by 
malicious third parties exploiting the system’s vulnerabilities. Cyberattacks against AI 
systems can leverage AI specific assets, such as training data sets (e.g. data poisoning) or 
trained models (e.g. adversarial attacks or membership inference), or exploit 
vulnerabilities in the AI system’s digital assets or the underlying ICT infrastructure. To 
ensure a level of cybersecurity appropriate to the risks, suitable measures, such as security 
controls, should therefore be taken by the providers of high-risk AI systems, also taking 
into account as appropriate the underlying ICT infrastructure.",[],"{'question_type': 'situational', 'seed_document_id': 84, 'situational_context': 'Amidst the labyrinth of regulations for high-risk AI systems, a legal consultant meticulously researches the EU AI Act to ensure compliance and safeguard fundamental rights against potential cybersecurity threats.', 'topic': 'High-Risk AI Systems'}","To ensure the robustness of high-risk AI systems in accordance with the EU AI Act, you should consider the following measures:

AI systems used in migration, asylum and border control management affect persons who 
are often in particularly vulnerable position and who are dependent on the outcome of the 
actions of the competent public authorities. The accuracy, non-discriminatory nature and 
transparency of the AI systems used in those contexts are therefore particularly important 
to guarantee respect for the fundamental rights of the affected persons, in particular their 
rights to free movement, non-discrimination, protection of private life and personal data, 
international protection and good administration. It is therefore appropriate to classify as 
high-risk, insofar as their use is permitted under relevant Union and national law, AI 
systems intended to be used by or on behalf of competent public authorities or by Union 
institutions, bodies, offices or agencies charged with tasks in the fields of migration,

2. **Application Examination**: These systems assist competent public authorities in examining applications for asylum, visas, or residence permits. They help in assessing the reliability of evidence related to these applications and associated complaints regarding eligibility.

3. **Detection and Identification**: AI systems are employed to detect, recognize, or identify individuals in the context of migration, asylum, and border control management. This is crucial for ensuring proper identification and processing of individuals seeking entry or protection.

4. **Support for Law Enforcement**: In some cases, AI systems may support law enforcement authorities in evaluating the reliability of evidence during investigations or prosecutions related to migration and asylum matters.

5. **Facilitating Decision-Making**: These systems can aid in making decisions regarding the granting, denial, or revocation of essential public assistance benefits and services, which are vital for individuals in vulnerable positions.

6. **Ensuring Compliance with Legal Obligations**: The use of AI systems must comply with relevant EU laws, including the UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the principle of non-refoulement, ensuring that fundamental rights are respected.

risk AI systems that are bodies governed by public law, or private entities providing 
public services and deployers of certain high-risk AI systems listed in an annex to this 
Regulation, such as banking or insurance entities, should carry out a fundamental 
rights impact assessment prior to putting it into use. Services important for individuals 
that are of public nature may also be provided by private entities. Private entities 
providing such public services are linked to tasks in the public interest such as in the 
areas of education, healthcare, social services, housing, administration of justice. The 
aim of the fundamental rights impact assessment is for the deployer to identify the 
specific risks to the rights of individuals or groups of individuals likely to be affected, 
identify measures to be taken in the case of a materialisation of those risks. The impact 
assessment should be performed prior to deploying the high-risk AI system, and should 
be updated when the deployer considers that any of the relevant factors have changed. 
The impact assessment should identify the deployer’s relevant processes in which the 
high-risk AI system will be used in line with its intended purpose, and should include a 
description of the period of time and frequency in which the system is intended to be 
used as well as of specific categories of natural persons and groups who are likely to be

specific context of use, such as arrangements for human oversight according to the 
instructions of use or, complaint handling and redress procedures, as they could be 
instrumental in mitigating risks to fundamental rights in concrete use-cases. After 
performing that impact assessment, the deployer should notify the relevant market

"What is a 'remote biometric identification system' as defined in the Regulation, and how do 'real-time' systems differ from 'post' systems in biometric identification?","A 'remote biometric identification system' is an AI system for identifying individuals without their active involvement by comparing biometric data to a reference database, while 'real-time' systems perform capturing, comparison, and identification instantaneously, unlike 'post' systems which involve a delay after data capture.","Document 17: EN
United in diversity
EN
(17)
The notion of ‘remote biometric identification system’ referred to in this Regulation should 
be defined functionally, as an AI system intended for the identification of natural persons 
without their active involvement, typically at a distance, through the comparison of a 
person’s biometric data with the biometric data contained in a reference database, 
irrespectively of the particular technology, processes or types of biometric data used. 
Such remote biometric identification systems are typically used to perceive multiple 
persons or their behaviour simultaneously in order to facilitate significantly the 
identification of natural persons without their active involvement. This excludes AI 
systems intended to be used for biometric verification, which includes authentication, the 
sole purpose of which is to confirm that a specific natural person is the person he or she 
claims to be and to confirm the identity of a natural person for the sole purpose of 
having access to a service, unlocking a device or having security access to premises. 
That exclusion is justified by the fact that such systems are likely to have a minor impact 
on fundamental rights of natural persons compared to the remote biometric 
identification systems which may be used for the processing of the biometric data of a 
large number of persons without their active involvement. In the case of ‘real-time’ 
systems, the capturing of the biometric data, the comparison and the identification occur all 
instantaneously, near-instantaneously or in any event without a significant delay. In this 
regard, there should be no scope for circumventing the rules of this Regulation on the ‘real-
time’ use of the AI systems concerned by providing for minor delays. ‘Real-time’ systems 
involve the use of ‘live’ or ‘near-live’ material, such as video footage, generated by a 
camera or other device with similar functionality. In the case of ‘post’ systems, in contrast, 
the biometric data has already been captured and the comparison and identification occur

   - Are designed to operate without significant delays, ensuring immediate identification.

2. **Post Systems**:
   - Involve the capturing of biometric data followed by a significant delay before comparison and identification occur.
   - Use previously recorded material, such as images or video footage from closed-circuit television (CCTV) or other devices.

The assessment should also include the identification of specific risks of harm likely to 
have an impact on the fundamental rights of those persons or groups. While performing 
this assessment, the deployer should take into account information relevant to a proper 
assessment of the impact, including but not limited to the information given by the 
provider of the high-risk AI system in the instructions for use. In light of the risks 
identified, deployers should determine measures to be taken in the case of a 
materialisation of those risks, including for example governance arrangements in that 
specific context of use, such as arrangements for human oversight according to the 
instructions of use or, complaint handling and redress procedures, as they could be 
instrumental in mitigating risks to fundamental rights in concrete use-cases. After 
performing that impact assessment, the deployer should notify the relevant market 
surveillance authority. Where appropriate, to collect relevant information necessary to 
perform the impact assessment, deployers of high-risk AI system, in particular when AI 
systems are used in the public sector, could involve relevant stakeholders, including the 
representatives of groups of persons likely to be affected by the AI system, independent 
experts, and civil society organisations in conducting such impact assessments and 
designing measures to be taken in the case of materialisation of the risks. The European 
Artificial Intelligence Office (AI Office) should develop a template for a questionnaire in 
order to facilitate compliance and reduce the administrative burden for deployers.

In order to efficiently ensure that fundamental rights are protected, deployers of high-
risk AI systems that are bodies governed by public law, or private entities providing 
public services and deployers of certain high-risk AI systems listed in an annex to this 
Regulation, such as banking or insurance entities, should carry out a fundamental 
rights impact assessment prior to putting it into use. Services important for individuals 
that are of public nature may also be provided by private entities. Private entities 
providing such public services are linked to tasks in the public interest such as in the 
areas of education, healthcare, social services, housing, administration of justice. The 
aim of the fundamental rights impact assessment is for the deployer to identify the 
specific risks to the rights of individuals or groups of individuals likely to be affected, 
identify measures to be taken in the case of a materialisation of those risks. The impact 
assessment should be performed prior to deploying the high-risk AI system, and should 
be updated when the deployer considers that any of the relevant factors have changed. 
The impact assessment should identify the deployer’s relevant processes in which the 
high-risk AI system will be used in line with its intended purpose, and should include a 
description of the period of time and frequency in which the system is intended to be 
used as well as of specific categories of natural persons and groups who are likely to be 
affected in the specific context of use.

The use of AI systems for real-time remote biometric identification of natural persons in 
publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement necessarily involves the 
processing of biometric data. The rules of this Regulation that prohibit, subject to certain 
exceptions, such use, which are based on Article 16 TFEU, should apply as lex specialis in 
respect of the rules on the processing of biometric data contained in Article 10 of Directive 
(EU) 2016/680, thus regulating such use and the processing of biometric data involved in 
an exhaustive manner. Therefore, such use and processing should be possible only in as far 
as it is compatible with the framework set by this Regulation, without there being scope, 
outside that framework, for the competent authorities, where they act for purpose of law 
enforcement, to use such systems and process such data in connection thereto on the 
grounds listed in Article 10 of Directive (EU) 2016/680. In that context, this Regulation is 
not intended to provide the legal basis for the processing of personal data under Article 8 
of Directive (EU) 2016/680. However, the use of real-time remote biometric identification 
systems in publicly accessible spaces for purposes other than law enforcement, including 
by competent authorities, should not be covered by the specific framework regarding such

indirectly dissuade the exercise of the freedom of assembly and other fundamental rights. 
Technical inaccuracies of AI systems intended for the remote biometric identification of 
natural persons can lead to biased results and entail discriminatory effects. Such 
possible biased results and discriminatory effects are particularly relevant with regard to 
age, ethnicity, race, sex or disabilities. In addition, the immediacy of the impact and the 
limited opportunities for further checks or corrections in relation to the use of such systems 
operating in real-time carry heightened risks for the rights and freedoms of the persons 
concerned in the context of, or impacted by, law enforcement activities.

prohibited, except in exhaustively listed and narrowly defined situations, where the use is 
strictly necessary to achieve a substantial public interest, the importance of which 
outweighs the risks. Those situations involve the search for certain victims of crime ▌ 
including missing persons; certain threats to the life or to the physical safety of natural 
persons or of a terrorist attack; and the localisation or identification of perpetrators or

criminal offences are punishable in the Member State concerned by a custodial sentence or 
a detention order for a maximum period of at least four years and as they are defined in the

### Requirements:
1. **Prior Authorization**: 
   - The use must be authorized by a judicial authority or an independent administrative authority in the Member State where the use is to take place.
   - In urgent situations, the system may be used without prior authorization, but a request must be made within 24 hours.

2. **Fundamental Rights Impact Assessment**: 
   - A fundamental rights impact assessment must be completed by the relevant law enforcement authority before use.

3. **Registration in Database**: 
   - The system must be registered in the EU database, unless the use is initiated in an urgent situation.

4. **Notification**: 
   - Each use must be notified to the relevant market surveillance authority and national data protection authority.

5. **Compliance with National Law**: 
   - The use must comply with necessary and proportionate safeguards and conditions as specified in national law, including limitations on time, geography, and personal scope.

6. **Specific Use Cases**: 
   - The use is limited to specific situations, such as searching for victims of crime, threats to life, or identifying perpetrators of serious criminal offenses.

### Potential Risks:
1. **Intrusiveness**: 
   - The use of such systems can intrude on the rights and freedoms of individuals, affecting their private lives and creating a sense of constant surveillance.

2. **Discriminatory Effects**: 
   - Technical inaccuracies may lead to biased results, disproportionately affecting certain groups based on age, ethnicity, race, sex, or disabilities.

3. **Limited Oversight**: 
   - The immediacy of the system's impact and the limited opportunities for checks or corrections can heighten risks to individuals' rights.

4. **Adverse Legal Effects**:

health and safety or the fundamental rights of persons, taking into account both the severity 
of the possible harm and its probability of occurrence and they are used in a number of 
specifically pre-defined areas specified in this Regulation. The identification of those 
systems is based on the same methodology and criteria envisaged also for any future

annex to this Regulation, it is appropriate to classify them as high-risk under this 
Regulation if the product concerned undergoes the conformity assessment procedure with a 
third-party conformity assessment body pursuant to that relevant Union harmonisation 
legislation. In particular, such products are machinery, toys, lifts, equipment and protective 
systems intended for use in potentially explosive atmospheres, radio equipment, pressure 
equipment, recreational craft equipment, cableway installations, appliances burning 
gaseous fuels, medical devices, in vitro diagnostic medical devices, automotive and 
aviation.

What are the differences?,"Remote biometric identification systems are intended for the identification of natural persons without their active involvement, while biometric verification systems are intended to confirm that a specific natural person is who they claim to be for access to services or security.","Document 17: EN
United in diversity
EN
(17)
The notion of ‘remote biometric identification system’ referred to in this Regulation should 
be defined functionally, as an AI system intended for the identification of natural persons 
without their active involvement, typically at a distance, through the comparison of a 
person’s biometric data with the biometric data contained in a reference database, 
irrespectively of the particular technology, processes or types of biometric data used. 
Such remote biometric identification systems are typically used to perceive multiple 
persons or their behaviour simultaneously in order to facilitate significantly the 
identification of natural persons without their active involvement. This excludes AI 
systems intended to be used for biometric verification, which includes authentication, the 
sole purpose of which is to confirm that a specific natural person is the person he or she 
claims to be and to confirm the identity of a natural person for the sole purpose of 
having access to a service, unlocking a device or having security access to premises. 
That exclusion is justified by the fact that such systems are likely to have a minor impact 
on fundamental rights of natural persons compared to the remote biometric 
identification systems which may be used for the processing of the biometric data of a 
large number of persons without their active involvement. In the case of ‘real-time’ 
systems, the capturing of the biometric data, the comparison and the identification occur all 
instantaneously, near-instantaneously or in any event without a significant delay. In this 
regard, there should be no scope for circumventing the rules of this Regulation on the ‘real-
time’ use of the AI systems concerned by providing for minor delays. ‘Real-time’ systems 
involve the use of ‘live’ or ‘near-live’ material, such as video footage, generated by a 
camera or other device with similar functionality. In the case of ‘post’ systems, in contrast, 
the biometric data has already been captured and the comparison and identification occur 
only after a significant delay. This involves material, such as pictures or video footage 
generated by closed circuit television cameras or private devices, which has been generated 
before the use of the system in respect of the natural persons concerned.","[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'I am looking to understand what distinguishes remote biometric identification systems from biometric verification systems according to the Regulation.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'How can I help you with that?'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'What are the differences?'}]","{'question_type': 'conversational', 'seed_document_id': 17, 'topic': 'Biometric Data and AI'}","The differences between remote biometric identification systems and biometric verification systems, as outlined in regulations like the EU AI Act, generally include the following:

1. **Purpose**:
   - **Remote Biometric Identification Systems**: These systems are designed to identify individuals from a distance, typically by comparing biometric data (like facial recognition) against a database of known individuals. The goal is to determine the identity of a person without their direct involvement.
   - **Biometric Verification Systems**: These systems are used to confirm or verify the identity of an individual by comparing their biometric data against a specific, known identity (e.g., a fingerprint or facial scan against a stored template). The focus is on confirming that the person is who they claim to be.

2. **Data Handling**:
   - **Remote Biometric Identification**: Often involves processing biometric data in real-time and may not require the individual's consent, especially in public spaces. It typically raises more privacy concerns due to its surveillance nature.
   - **Biometric Verification**: Usually requires the individual's consent and is often used in secure environments (like unlocking a phone or accessing a secure area). It is more focused on personal authentication.

3. **Context of Use**:
   - **Remote Biometric Identification**: Commonly used in law enforcement, public safety, and surveillance applications where identifying individuals in a crowd is necessary.
   - **Biometric Verification**: Commonly used in personal devices, secure access systems, and situations where an individual needs to prove their identity.

4. **Regulatory Implications**:
   - **Remote Biometric Identification**: May be subject to stricter regulations due to its potential for mass surveillance and privacy violations.
   - **Biometric Verification**: While still regulated, it may have more lenient requirements since it typically involves individual consent and is used in more controlled environments.

These distinctions are important for understanding the regulatory landscape and the implications for privacy and data protection.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed comparison of remote biometric identification systems and biometric verification systems, but it does not directly address the core difference as stated in the ground truth.

Where appropriate, national competent authorities establishing AI regulatory sandboxes 
should cooperate with other relevant authorities, including those supervising the 
protection of fundamental rights, and could allow for the involvement of other actors 
within the AI ecosystem such as national or European standardisation organisations, 
notified bodies, testing and experimentation facilities, research and experimentation 
labs, European Digital Innovation Hubs and relevant stakeholder and civil society 
organisations. To ensure uniform implementation across the Union and economies of 
scale, it is appropriate to establish common rules for the AI regulatory sandboxes’ 
implementation and a framework for cooperation between the relevant authorities 
involved in the supervision of the sandboxes. AI regulatory sandboxes established under 
this Regulation should be without prejudice to other law allowing for the establishment 
of other sandboxes aiming to ensure compliance with law other than this Regulation. 
Where appropriate, relevant competent authorities in charge of those other regulatory 
sandboxes should consider the benefits of using those sandboxes also for the purpose of 
ensuring compliance of AI systems with this Regulation. Upon agreement between the 
national competent authorities and the participants in the AI regulatory sandbox, testing 
in real world conditions may also be operated and supervised in the framework of the AI 
regulatory sandbox.
