New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection 
 
Notice of Adoption of Final Rule 
 
Pursuant to the authority vested in the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection by 
Sections 1043 and 2203(f) of the New York City Charter and Section 20-104(b) of the New York City 
Administrative Code, and in accordance with the requirements of Section 1043 of the New York City Charter, 
the Department amends Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York.  
 
An initial version of this rule was proposed and published on September 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on 
November 4, 2022, and comments regarding the rule were received. DCWP proposed a second version of this 
rule on December 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on January 23, 2023, and comments regarding the rule 
were received.  
 
Statement of Basis and Purpose 
 
The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP” or “Department”) is adding rules to implement 
new legislation regarding automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”). Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits 
employers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has 
been subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly 
available, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   
 
These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

Historical data.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex_situational', 'seed_document_id': 0, 'topic': 'Requirements'}","In New York City, an **automated employment decision tool (AEDT)** is defined as any computational process, including algorithms and machine learning models, that is used to make decisions about employment, such as hiring, promotions, or terminations. This can include tools that screen resumes, assess candidates, or evaluate employee performance.

As of January 1, 2023, New York City has specific requirements for employers using AEDTs, primarily outlined in the **Local Law 144**. Here are the key conditions that need to be met before using an AEDT:

1. **Bias Audit**: Employers must conduct a bias audit of the AEDT at least once every year. This audit should assess whether the tool has a disparate impact on individuals based on protected characteristics, such as race, gender, or age.

2. **Disclosure**: Employers are required to notify candidates that an AEDT will be used in the hiring process. This notification must be provided at least 10 days before the tool is used.

3. **Data Transparency**: Employers must provide information about the AEDT, including its purpose and how it works, upon request. This includes details about the data used to train the tool and the criteria it employs to make decisions.

4. **Recordkeeping**: Employers should maintain records of the audits and any relevant data regarding the AEDT's performance and impact on candidates.

5. **Compliance with Other Laws**: Employers must ensure that their use of AEDTs complies with all applicable federal, state, and local laws, including anti-discrimination laws.

6. **Candidate Rights**: Candidates should be informed of their rights regarding the use of AEDTs, including the ability to request an alternative assessment method if they believe the tool may not accurately reflect their qualifications.

By adhering to these requirements, employers can help ensure that their use of automated tools in employment decisions is fair, transparent, and compliant with local regulations.",False,"The agent's definition of an automated employment decision tool is not fully aligned with the ground truth, which emphasizes the tool's output as a score, classification, or recommendation. Additionally, the conditions listed by the agent do not include the requirement for the audit results to be publicly available, which is a key aspect of the ground truth.",0.4074074074074074,0.8393495678901672,4.0,"The generated answer accurately defines an automated employment decision tool and covers most of the key conditions required for its use in New York City, but it includes some additional details that, while correct, are not explicitly mentioned in the reference answer."
"In the context of a bias audit, what is the definition of 'test data' and when can it be used?",'Test data' refers to data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.,"Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

This data is typically separate from the training data and is designed to assess how well the model generalizes to new, unseen examples. 

### Definition of Test Data:
- **Test Data**: A collection of data points that are not used during the training phase of a machine learning model. It is employed to evaluate the model's accuracy, robustness, and potential biases after it has been trained.

### When Test Data Can Be Used:
1. **Model Evaluation**: After training a model, test data is used to measure its performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
  
2. **Bias Detection**: Test data can help identify biases in the model's predictions by analyzing how different demographic groups are treated. For instance, if the model performs significantly worse for a particular group, this may indicate bias.

3. **Fairness Assessment**: Test data can be used to assess fairness metrics, such as disparate impact or equal opportunity, ensuring that the model does not disproportionately disadvantage any group.

4. **Regulatory Compliance**: In contexts where fairness and accountability are mandated (e.g., hiring algorithms, credit scoring), test data can be used to demonstrate compliance with legal and ethical standards.

5. **Model Comparison**: Test data allows for the comparison of different models or algorithms to determine which one performs better in terms of both accuracy and fairness.

In summary, test data is crucial for evaluating the effectiveness and fairness of machine learning models, particularly in the context of bias audits, where the goal is to ensure equitable treatment across different groups.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed explanation of 'test data' in the context of a bias audit, but it does not align with the ground truth definition, which specifies that 'test data' is data used for a bias audit that is not historical data.",0.4166666666666667,0.957728922367096,4.0,"The generated answer provides a comprehensive definition of 'test data' and explains its uses in the context of a bias audit, addressing all components of the query with only minor deviations from the reference answer."
"As an employer conducting a bias audit, I want to know the threshold for excluding a category from impact ratio calculations. Can you clarify what percentage of data a category must represent to be excluded?",An independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio.,"Document 16: (d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex_situational', 'seed_document_id': 16, 'topic': 'Metrics/Data'}","When conducting a bias audit and determining thresholds for excluding a category from impact ratio calculations, a common practice is to consider categories that represent a very small percentage of the total data. While there isn't a universally accepted threshold, many organizations use a guideline of around 1% to 5% of the total dataset.

Here are some considerations:

1. **1% Threshold**: If a category represents less than 1% of the total data, it is often considered too small to have a meaningful impact on the overall analysis and may be excluded.

2. **5% Threshold**: Some organizations may opt for a slightly higher threshold, such as 5%, to ensure that even smaller categories are included if they might still have relevance in the context of the audit.

3. **Contextual Factors**: Consider the context of your specific industry, the size of your dataset, and the potential implications of excluding certain categories. In some cases, even a small percentage might be significant.

4. **Statistical Significance**: Ensure that any exclusion does not compromise the statistical validity of your findings. Categories that are too small may lead to unreliable conclusions.

5. **Documentation**: Clearly document your criteria for exclusion to maintain transparency in your audit process.

Ultimately, the decision should align with your organization's goals and the specific context of the audit.",False,"The agent's answer suggests a range of 1% to 5% for exclusion, while the ground truth specifies a threshold of less than 2%.

Historical data.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex_situational', 'seed_document_id': 0, 'topic': 'Requirements'}","### Simplified Definition

An **automated employment decision tool** (AEDT) is a software or algorithm used by employers to help make decisions about hiring, promotions, or other employment-related actions. These tools analyze data (like resumes, assessments, or performance metrics) to predict which candidates are the best fit for a job or to evaluate employee performance.

### Impact on Employment Decisions

1. **Efficiency**: AEDTs can process large amounts of data quickly, helping employers sift through many applications or performance records.
2. **Bias and Fairness**: If not designed carefully, these tools can perpetuate or even amplify biases present in the data they use, leading to unfair treatment of certain groups.
3. **Consistency**: They can help standardize decision-making processes, making them more uniform across candidates or employees.
4. **Transparency**: Depending on how they are implemented, AEDTs can either enhance or hinder transparency in hiring and promotion processes.

### Requirements for Using AEDTs

In many cities, there are specific regulations governing the use of AEDTs to ensure fairness and transparency. Here are some common requirements:

1. **Bias Audits**: Employers may be required to conduct regular audits to check for bias in the tool's outcomes.
2. **Transparency**: Employers might need to disclose to candidates that an AEDT is being used and provide information about how it works.
3. **Data Privacy**: Compliance with data protection laws is essential, ensuring that personal information is handled responsibly.
4. **Human Oversight**: There may be a requirement for human review of decisions made by the AEDT, especially in critical employment decisions.
5. **Accessibility**: Employers might need to ensure that the tool is accessible to all candidates, including those with disabilities.

### Conclusion

Using an automated employment decision tool can streamline hiring and evaluation processes, but it also comes with responsibilities to ensure fairness, transparency, and compliance with local regulations.",False,"The agent's definition of an automated employment decision tool is overly simplified and does not capture the comprehensive nature of the ground truth definition, which includes specific references to machine learning, statistical modeling, and the impact on discretionary decision-making.",0.8571428571428571,0.7716233730316162,5.0,"The generated answer provides a clear and accurate definition of an automated employment decision tool, thoroughly explains its impact on employment decisions, and outlines relevant requirements for its use, aligning closely with the reference answer without any factual errors."

This can include tools that use artificial intelligence, machine learning, or other automated processes to evaluate candidates or employees based on various criteria.

### Key Requirements for Using AEDTs in NYC:

1. **Bias Audit**: 
   - Employers must conduct a bias audit of the AEDT at least once every year. This audit should assess whether the tool has a disparate impact on any protected groups under the New York City Human Rights Law.

2. **Disclosure**:
   - Employers are required to notify candidates that an AEDT will be used in the hiring process. This notification must be provided at least 10 days before the tool is used.
   - The notice should include information about the AEDT, such as its purpose and how it works.

3. **Data Transparency**:
   - Employers must provide information about the data used to train the AEDT, including the sources of the data and any potential biases that may exist in the data set.

4. **Candidate Rights**:
   - Candidates have the right to request an explanation of how the AEDT works and how it affects their employment decisions. Employers should be prepared to provide this information.

5. **Record Keeping**:
   - Employers should maintain records of the audits and any communications regarding the use of the AEDT for a specified period, typically three years.

6. **Compliance with Other Laws**:
   - Employers must ensure that their use of AEDTs complies with all applicable federal, state, and local laws, including anti-discrimination laws.

### Additional Considerations:

- **Impact Assessment**: Employers may want to conduct their own assessments to understand how the AEDT impacts different demographic groups and to ensure that it aligns with their diversity and inclusion goals.
  
- **Vendor Responsibility**: If using a third-party AEDT, employers should ensure that the vendor complies with these requirements and may need to include compliance clauses in contracts.

§ 20-870 Definitions.
For the purposes of this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings:
   Automated employment decision tool. The term ""automated employment decision tool"" means any computational process, derived from machine
learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence, that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation,
that is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons. The term
""automated employment decision tool"" does not include a tool that does not automate, support, substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-
making processes and that does not materially impact natural persons, including, but not limited to, a junk email filter, firewall, antivirus software,
calculator, spreadsheet, database, data set, or other compilation of data.
   Bias audit. The term ""bias audit"" means an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor. Such bias audit shall include but not be limited to the
testing of an automated employment decision tool to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported
by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of
federal regulations.
   Employment decision. The term ""employment decision"" means to screen candidates for employment or employees for promotion within the city.
(L.L. 2021/144, 12/11/2021, eff. 1/1/2023)
§ 20-871 Requirements for automated employment decision tools.
   a.   In the city, it shall be unlawful for an employer or an employment agency to use an automated employment decision tool to screen a candidate or
employee for an employment decision unless:
      1.   Such tool has been the subject of a bias audit conducted no more than one year prior to the use of such tool; and
      2.   A summary of the results of the most recent bias audit of such tool as well as the distribution date of the tool to which such audit applies has been
made publicly available on the website of the employer or employment agency prior to the use of such tool.
   b.   Notices required.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex_situational', 'seed_document_id': 23, 'topic': 'Metrics/Data'}","A bias audit for automated employment decision tools is a systematic evaluation designed to identify and mitigate biases in algorithms used for hiring, promotions, and other employment-related decisions. In New York City, this is particularly relevant due to the local laws aimed at ensuring fairness and transparency in the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and automated systems in employment.

### Purpose of a Bias Audit

1. **Identify Biases**: The primary goal is to detect any biases that may exist in the algorithms. This includes examining how different demographic groups (e.g., based on race, gender, age) are affected by the automated decision-making processes.

2. **Ensure Fairness**: By identifying biases, employers can take steps to ensure that their hiring practices are fair and equitable, reducing the risk of discrimination against certain groups.

3. **Compliance with Regulations**: In New York City, the Local Law 144 requires employers to conduct bias audits for automated employment decision tools. This law mandates that employers assess the impact of these tools on various demographic groups to ensure compliance with anti-discrimination laws.

4. **Enhance Transparency**: A bias audit promotes transparency in how automated tools make decisions, which can help build trust with candidates and employees.

5. **Improve Decision-Making**: By understanding the biases in their tools, employers can refine their algorithms, leading to better hiring decisions and improved organizational outcomes.

### Why It Is Required

1. **Legal Compliance**: As mentioned, New York City has specific regulations that require bias audits for automated employment decision tools. Non-compliance can lead to legal repercussions, including fines and lawsuits.

2. **Protecting Employee Rights**: The audits help protect the rights of employees and job applicants by ensuring that automated systems do not perpetuate existing biases or create new forms of discrimination.

3. **Promoting Diversity and Inclusion**: By addressing biases, employers can foster a more diverse and inclusive workplace, which has been shown to enhance creativity, innovation, and overall business performance.

4. **Reputation Management**: Companies that actively work to eliminate bias in their hiring processes can enhance their reputation as fair and equitable employers, which can attract top talent.

5. **Social Responsibility**: Conducting bias audits aligns with broader societal goals of equity and justice, demonstrating a commitment to ethical practices in business.

In summary, a bias audit is a critical tool for employers in New York City to ensure that their automated employment decision tools are fair, compliant with local laws, and aligned with best practices in diversity and inclusion.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed explanation of what a bias audit entails and its importance, but it does not specifically address the legal requirements outlined in the ground truth, which references specific legal codes and reporting requirements.",0.25,0.9196890592575072,5.0,"The generated answer thoroughly explains the purpose of a bias audit for automated employment decision tools, addresses all components of the user query accurately, and provides relevant details about legal compliance and societal implications without any errors."
I'm reviewing a policy document and came across the term 'Impact Ratio.' Can you explain what it means and how it is calculated?,"The 'Impact Ratio' can be calculated as either the selection rate for a category divided by the selection rate of the most selected category, or the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the highest scoring category.","Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

iii. 
at any point during the bias audit, has a direct financial interest or a material indirect 
financial interest in an employer or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to 
use the  AEDT or in a vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT. 
 
Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.  
 
 
 
    _________selection rate for a category________  
Impact Ratio =        selection rate of the most selected category  
 
OR 
 
  
 
     ______scoring rate for a category__________  
Impact Ratio =        scoring rate of the highest scoring category 
 
 
Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex_situational', 'seed_document_id': 10, 'topic': 'Metrics/Data'}","The term ""Impact Ratio"" can refer to different metrics depending on the context in which it is used, but it generally measures the effectiveness or influence of a particular action, program, or investment relative to its costs or inputs. Here are a couple of common interpretations:

1. **In Research and Academia**: The Impact Ratio might refer to the ratio of citations to the number of publications. It can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Impact Ratio} = \frac{\text{Total Citations}}{\text{Total Publications}}
   \]
   This ratio helps assess the influence of a researcher or a specific body of work within the academic community.

2. **In Business or Project Management**: The Impact Ratio could measure the benefits gained from a project relative to its costs. It can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Impact Ratio} = \frac{\text{Total Benefits}}{\text{Total Costs}}
   \]
   A ratio greater than 1 indicates that the benefits outweigh the costs, while a ratio less than 1 suggests the opposite.

3. **In Social Impact Assessment**: The Impact Ratio might be used to evaluate the social or environmental benefits of a project compared to its financial investment. This could involve more complex calculations that take into account various qualitative and quantitative factors.

To calculate the Impact Ratio, you need to clearly define what constitutes ""impact"" and ""costs"" in your specific context. Once you have the necessary data, you can apply the appropriate formula to derive the ratio. 

If you have a specific context in mind, I can provide a more tailored explanation!",False,"The agent's explanation of 'Impact Ratio' does not match the ground truth definition, which specifies it as a calculation involving selection rates or scoring rates for categories.",0.0,0.0,3.0,"The generated answer provides a broad interpretation of ""Impact Ratio"" with multiple contexts but fails to address the specific calculation method mentioned in the reference answer, leading to partial correctness."

New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection 
 
Notice of Adoption of Final Rule 
 
Pursuant to the authority vested in the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection by 
Sections 1043 and 2203(f) of the New York City Charter and Section 20-104(b) of the New York City 
Administrative Code, and in accordance with the requirements of Section 1043 of the New York City Charter, 
the Department amends Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York.  
 
An initial version of this rule was proposed and published on September 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on 
November 4, 2022, and comments regarding the rule were received. DCWP proposed a second version of this 
rule on December 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on January 23, 2023, and comments regarding the rule 
were received.  
 
Statement of Basis and Purpose 
 
The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP” or “Department”) is adding rules to implement 
new legislation regarding automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”). Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits 
employers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has 
been subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly 
available, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   
 
These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

Section 1.  Chapter 5 of Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York is amended to add Subchapter T to read 
as follows: 
Subchapter T: Automated Employment Decision Tools 
§ 5-300. Definitions. 
As used in this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings: 
 
Automated Employment Decision Tool. “Automated employment decision tool” or “AEDT” means 
“Automated employment decision tool” as defined by § 20-870 of the Code where the phrase “to 
substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making” means: 
i. 
to rely solely on a simplified output (score, tag, classification, ranking, etc.), with no other 
factors considered; or 
ii. 
 to use a simplified output as one of a set of criteria where the simplified output is weighted 
more than any other criterion in the set; or   
iii. 
to use a simplified output to overrule conclusions derived from other factors including 
human decision-making.  
  
Bias Audit. “Bias audit” means “Bias audit” as defined by § 20-870 of the Code.  
 
Candidate for Employment. “Candidate for employment” means a person who has applied for a specific 
employment position by submitting the necessary information or items in the format required by the 
employer or employment agency.  
 
Category. “Category” means any component 1 category required to be reported by employers pursuant 
to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States Code as specified in part 1602.7 of 
title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, as designated on the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission Employer Information Report EEO-1. 
 
Code. “Code” means the Administrative Code of the City of New York. 
 
Distribution Date. “Distribution date” means the date the employer or employment agency began using 
a specific AEDT.  
 
Employment Decision. “Employment decision” means “Employment decision” as defined by § 20-870

Historical data.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex_situational', 'seed_document_id': 4, 'topic': 'Requirements'}","Certainly! The term ""Automated Employment Decision Tool"" (AEDT) is defined in the New York City Administrative Code as any computational process, including algorithms and machine learning models, that is used to assist in making employment decisions. This can include hiring, promotions, and other employment-related decisions.

### Key Aspects of AEDT:
1. **Automation**: The tool automates part of the decision-making process, which can involve analyzing data to predict candidate suitability or performance.
2. **Data-Driven**: It often relies on data inputs, which can include resumes, assessments, and other metrics to evaluate candidates.
3. **Decision-Making**: The tool is used to influence or make decisions about employment, such as who to interview, hire, or promote.

### Examples of AEDT Usage:
1. **Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)**: These systems can filter resumes based on keywords or qualifications, helping employers identify candidates who meet specific criteria.
  
2. **Predictive Analytics**: Some companies use algorithms to analyze past employee performance data to predict which candidates are likely to succeed in a particular role.

3. **Assessment Tools**: Online assessments that evaluate skills or personality traits can be considered AEDTs if they are used to make decisions about hiring or promotions.

4. **Interview Scheduling Software**: Tools that automatically schedule interviews based on candidate availability and interviewer schedules can also fall under this definition.

5. **Performance Evaluation Tools**: Systems that analyze employee performance data to recommend promotions or raises can be classified as AEDTs.

### Regulatory Context:
In New York City, the use of AEDTs is subject to regulations aimed at ensuring fairness and transparency. Employers must conduct bias audits and provide candidates with information about the tools used in the hiring process. This is to mitigate potential discrimination and ensure that the tools are not unfairly disadvantaging certain groups.

Understanding AEDTs is crucial for both employers and job seekers, as it highlights the growing role of technology in the hiring process and the importance of ethical considerations in its application.",False,"The agent's definition of 'Automated Employment Decision Tool' does not accurately reflect the specific criteria outlined in the ground truth. The ground truth emphasizes the tool's role in substantially assisting or replacing discretionary decision-making, which the agent's response does not clearly convey.",0.34375,0.8515501618385315,4.0,"The generated answer accurately defines 'Automated Employment Decision Tool' and provides relevant examples, but it lacks a direct reference to the specific definition from the New York City Administrative Code, which slightly affects its completeness."
"In the bias audit calculations, what is the minimum percentage of data that can be excluded from the calculations? Can you provide an example of a category that can be excluded and the information that should be included in the summary of results?",An independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio.,"Document 16: (d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex_situational', 'seed_document_id': 16, 'topic': 'Metrics/Data'}","In bias audit calculations, the minimum percentage of data that can be excluded typically depends on the specific guidelines or standards set by the auditing framework being used. However, a common practice is to exclude a small percentage, often around 5-10%, to ensure that the results remain statistically valid and representative.

### Example of a Category That Can Be Excluded:
**Category: Outliers or Anomalous Data Points**

For instance, if you are auditing a machine learning model's predictions, you might choose to exclude data points that are considered outliers—those that fall significantly outside the expected range of values. This could include instances where the input features are erroneous or where the target variable is not representative of the population.

### Information to Include in the Summary of Results:
1. **Exclusion Rationale**: Clearly state why certain data points were excluded (e.g., outliers, missing values, or irrelevant categories).
  
2. **Percentage of Data Excluded**: Specify the percentage of the total dataset that was excluded and how it was determined.

3. **Impact on Results**: Discuss how the exclusion of this data might affect the overall findings of the audit. For example, does it lead to a more accurate representation of bias?

4. **Remaining Data Characteristics**: Provide a summary of the characteristics of the remaining data, such as demographic distributions, feature distributions, and any relevant statistics.

5. **Final Results**: Present the results of the bias audit based on the remaining data, including any metrics or visualizations that illustrate the findings.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure that your bias audit is both rigorous and transparent, allowing stakeholders to understand the implications of the exclusions made during the analysis.",False,"The agent's answer does not provide the specific minimum percentage of data that can be excluded, which is stated as less than 2% in the ground truth. Additionally, the example and details provided do not align with the expected answer.",0.15,0.0,2.0,"The generated answer provides a general guideline for data exclusion percentages but does not specify the minimum percentage of 2% as stated in the reference answer, and while it includes relevant examples, it contains significant inaccuracies regarding the exclusion percentage."
What information about bias audits of an AEDT must be publicly available before its use?,"Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency must make publicly available on their website the date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results. The summary should include the source and explanation of the data used for the bias audit, the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT falling within an unknown category, and the number of applicants or candidates, selection or scoring rates, and impact ratios for all categories.","Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

This audit aims to ensure that the tools do not disproportionately disadvantage any particular group based on protected characteristics such as race, gender, age, or disability.

### Key Aspects of a Bias Audit:

1. **Assessment of Algorithms**: The audit examines the algorithms and data used in the AEDTs to identify any potential biases that may arise from the training data or the decision-making processes.

2. **Data Analysis**: It involves analyzing the outcomes produced by the AEDTs to determine if there are disparities in how different demographic groups are treated.

3. **Recommendations for Mitigation**: The audit may provide recommendations for improving the tool to reduce bias, such as adjusting the algorithms, changing the data inputs, or implementing additional checks.

4. **Documentation**: The findings of the audit should be documented, and organizations may be required to maintain records of the audit process and results.

### Who Can Conduct a Bias Audit:

- **Independent Auditors**: The audit must be conducted by an independent third party that has expertise in algorithmic fairness and bias assessment. This ensures objectivity and credibility in the evaluation process.

- **Qualified Professionals**: The auditors should have a background in data science, statistics, or a related field, along with experience in assessing bias in automated systems.

- **Compliance with Regulations**: The auditors should be familiar with the specific regulations and guidelines set forth by the New York City law regarding AEDTs to ensure compliance.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for

for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Here’s a breakdown of the requirements and steps involved in performing a bias audit, including the calculation of impact ratios for various demographic categories.

### Requirements for Conducting a Bias Audit

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Gather data on applicants, including demographic information (e.g., sex, race/ethnicity) and outcomes (e.g., whether they were screened in or out, scheduled for interviews).
   - Ensure that the data is anonymized to protect individual privacy.

2. **Define Protected Categories**:
   - Identify the categories you will analyze, such as:
     - Sex (male, female, non-binary, etc.)
     - Race/Ethnicity (e.g., White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, etc.)
     - Intersectional categories (e.g., Black females, Hispanic males, etc.)

3. **Establish Baseline Metrics**:
   - Determine the overall acceptance rates for all applicants and for each demographic category.

4. **Impact Ratio Calculation**:
   - The impact ratio is calculated to assess the relative impact of the AEDT on different demographic groups. It is defined as:
     \[
     \text{Impact Ratio} = \frac{\text{Acceptance Rate of Protected Group}}{\text{Acceptance Rate of Reference Group}}
     \]
   - **Acceptance Rate** is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Acceptance Rate} = \frac{\text{Number of Applicants Accepted}}{\text{Total Number of Applicants}}
     \]

5. **Reference Group**:
   - Choose a reference group, typically the group with the highest acceptance rate (often White males in many contexts).

6. **Analysis**:
   - Calculate the acceptance rates for each demographic group.
   - Compute the impact ratios for each group compared to the reference group.
   - An impact ratio of less than 0.8 may indicate potential bias against that group.

7. **Intersectional Analysis**:
   - For intersectional categories, calculate acceptance rates and impact ratios for combinations of demographic factors (e.g., Black females).
   - This helps identify compounded biases that may not be visible when looking at single categories.

8. **Documentation and Reporting**:
   - Document the methodology, findings, and any identified biases.
   - Prepare a report that includes recommendations for mitigating any identified biases.

9. **Remediation Strategies**:
   - If biases are found, consider adjusting the AEDT, revising the criteria used for screening, or implementing additional training for hiring personnel.

10. **Ongoing Monitoring**:
    - Establish a process for ongoing monitoring and auditing of the AEDT to ensure continued fairness and compliance.

### Conclusion

Conducting a bias audit of an AEDT involves careful data collection, analysis of acceptance rates, and impact ratios across various demographic categories. By following these steps, you can identify and address potential biases in your hiring process, ensuring a fairer and more equitable approach to recruitment.",False,"While the agent's answer provides a comprehensive overview of conducting a bias audit, it does not specifically mention the requirement to report selection rates to the EEOC or the need to indicate individuals not included in the calculations due to unknown categories, which are key elements of the ground truth.",0.7333333333333333,0.7537179589271545,4.0,"The generated answer provides a comprehensive overview of the requirements for conducting a bias audit of an AEDT, covering all necessary components, but it lacks specific mention of the need to report the number of individuals not included in the calculations due to unknown categories."

individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

1. **Historical Data**: Your own historical data can be a valuable starting point, especially if it reflects a significant sample size and includes various demographic groups. However, it may not capture broader trends or biases present in the wider labor market.

2. **External Data**: Incorporating data from other employers or industry benchmarks can help contextualize your findings. This can provide insights into whether the biases observed in your data are consistent with broader patterns.

3. **Diversity of Data**: Using a mix of your own data and external data can help mitigate the risk of bias that may be unique to your organization. It can also enhance the robustness of your audit.

4. **Regulatory Compliance**: Depending on your jurisdiction, there may be legal requirements regarding bias audits that specify the types of data you need to use. Be sure to check any relevant regulations.

5. **Consulting Experts**: If possible, consider consulting with experts in data analysis or bias auditing to ensure that your methodology is sound and that you are interpreting the data correctly.

Here’s a breakdown of the requirements for conducting a bias audit, including the calculation of impact ratios for different race/ethnicity and sex categories.

### Requirements for a Bias Audit

1. **Data Collection**: 
   - Gather demographic data on applicants and hires, including race/ethnicity and sex categories.
   - Ensure that the data is collected in a way that complies with privacy laws and regulations.

2. **Analysis of Selection Rates**:
   - Calculate the selection rates for each demographic group. This involves determining the percentage of applicants from each group who are selected for the next stage in the hiring process.

3. **Impact Ratio Calculation**:
   - The impact ratio is calculated by dividing the selection rate of a protected group by the selection rate of the majority group (often referred to as the ""reference group"").
   - **Formula**: 
     \[
     \text{Impact Ratio} = \frac{\text{Selection Rate of Protected Group}}{\text{Selection Rate of Reference Group}}
     \]
   - An impact ratio of less than 0.8 (or 80%) is often considered a potential indicator of adverse impact.

4. **Evaluation of Results**:
   - Review the impact ratios for all demographic groups. If any group has an impact ratio below 0.8, further investigation is warranted to understand the cause of the disparity.
   - Consider conducting a root cause analysis to identify whether the AEDT is contributing to bias.

5. **Remediation**:
   - If bias is identified, take steps to mitigate it. This could involve adjusting the AEDT, changing the hiring process, or providing additional training for hiring managers.

6. **Documentation**:
   - Document the entire process, including data collection methods, calculations, findings, and any actions taken to address identified biases. This documentation is essential for compliance and transparency.

7. **Ongoing Monitoring**:
   - Implement a plan for ongoing monitoring of the AEDT’s impact on hiring decisions to ensure that any biases are continuously addressed.

### Additional Considerations

- **Legal Compliance**: Ensure that your bias audit complies with relevant laws and regulations, such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) guidelines.
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Involve stakeholders, including legal counsel and diversity and inclusion experts, in the audit process to ensure a comprehensive approach.
- **Transparency**: Be transparent with applicants about how the AEDT works and how their data will be used.

By following these guidelines, you can conduct a thorough bias audit of your AEDT and work towards ensuring fair and equitable hiring practices.",False,"While the agent's answer provides a detailed explanation of the bias audit process, it does not mention the requirement to indicate the number of individuals not included in the calculations due to unknown categories, which is part of the ground truth.",0.6,0.8714550137519836,4.0,"The generated answer provides a comprehensive overview of the requirements for a bias audit, correctly addressing the calculation of impact ratios and selection rates, but it lacks mention of the need to indicate individuals not included in the calculations due to unknown categories, which is a key component of the reference answer."
I want to conduct a bias audit for an AEDT. What are the specific requirements for calculating the impact ratio for different race/ethnicity and sex categories?,"A bias audit of an AEDT must, at a minimum, calculate the selection rate for each category, calculate the impact ratio for each category, separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories, ensure that the calculations are performed for each group if the AEDT classifies candidates into specified groups, and indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT that are not included in the required calculations because they fall within an unknown category.","Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Document 6: 2 
 
 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to

Here are the specific requirements and considerations:

### 1. **Data Collection**
   - **Demographic Data**: Collect data on the race/ethnicity and sex of all applicants and employees affected by the AEDT.
   - **Outcome Data**: Gather data on the outcomes of the AEDT, such as hiring, promotion, or other employment decisions.

### 2. **Defining Groups**
   - **Protected Categories**: Clearly define the race/ethnicity and sex categories you will analyze. Common categories include:
     - Race/Ethnicity: White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, etc.
     - Sex: Male, Female, Non-binary, etc.

### 3. **Calculating Impact Ratios**
   - **Selection Rates**: Calculate the selection rate for each demographic group. This is done by dividing the number of individuals selected by the total number of individuals in that group.
     \[
     \text{Selection Rate} = \frac{\text{Number Selected}}{\text{Total in Group}}
     \]
   - **Impact Ratio**: The impact ratio compares the selection rates of different groups. It is calculated by dividing the selection rate of the protected group by the selection rate of the reference group (often the group with the highest selection rate).
     \[
     \text{Impact Ratio} = \frac{\text{Selection Rate of Protected Group}}{\text{Selection Rate of Reference Group}}
     \]

### 4. **Interpreting Results**
   - An impact ratio of 1 indicates no disparity, while ratios below 1 indicate a disadvantage for the protected group. Ratios above 1 indicate an advantage.
   - Ratios significantly below 0.8 may indicate potential bias or discrimination.

### 5. **Statistical Significance**
   - Consider conducting statistical tests (e.g., Chi-square tests) to determine if the differences in selection rates are statistically significant.

### 6. **Documentation and Reporting**
   - Document all findings, methodologies, and any assumptions made during the audit.
   - Prepare a report that includes:
     - Summary of data collected
     - Calculations of selection rates and impact ratios
     - Analysis of results and any identified biases
     - Recommendations for mitigating bias in the AEDT.

### 7. **Compliance and Best Practices**
   - Ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations (e.g., EEOC guidelines).
   - Consider best practices for fairness and transparency in the use of AEDTs.

### 8. **Stakeholder Engagement**
   - Engage with stakeholders, including affected groups, to discuss findings and gather feedback.

I'm reviewing a policy document and came across the term 'Impact Ratio'. Can you explain what it means and how it is calculated?,"The 'Impact Ratio' can be calculated by either dividing the selection rate for a category by the selection rate of the most selected category, or dividing the scoring rate for a category by the scoring rate for the highest scoring category.","Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF

Example.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex_situational', 'seed_document_id': 10, 'topic': 'Metrics/Data'}","The term ""Impact Ratio"" can refer to different metrics depending on the context in which it is used, but it generally measures the effectiveness or influence of a particular action, program, or investment relative to its costs or inputs. Here are a couple of common interpretations:

1. **In Research and Academia**: The Impact Ratio might refer to the ratio of citations to the number of publications. It can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Impact Ratio} = \frac{\text{Total Citations}}{\text{Total Publications}}
   \]
   This ratio helps assess the influence of a researcher or a specific body of work within the academic community.

2. **In Business or Project Management**: The Impact Ratio could measure the benefits gained from a project relative to its costs. It can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Impact Ratio} = \frac{\text{Total Benefits}}{\text{Total Costs}}
   \]
   A ratio greater than 1 indicates that the benefits outweigh the costs, while a ratio less than 1 suggests the opposite.

3. **In Social Impact Assessment**: The Impact Ratio might be used to evaluate the social or environmental benefits of a project compared to its financial investment. This could be calculated similarly to the business context but may include qualitative factors.

### Calculation Steps:
1. **Define the Scope**: Determine what you are measuring (e.g., citations, benefits, costs).
2. **Collect Data**: Gather the necessary data for total citations, publications, benefits, and costs.
3. **Apply the Formula**: Use the appropriate formula based on your context.
4. **Interpret the Results**: Analyze the ratio to understand the impact.

### Example:
If a researcher has 100 publications and those publications have received 500 citations, the Impact Ratio would be:
\[
\text{Impact Ratio} = \frac{500}{100} = 5
\]
This indicates that, on average, each publication has been cited 5 times.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex_situational', 'seed_document_id': 15, 'topic': 'Metrics/Data'}","Conducting a bias audit for an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT) involves several steps, particularly when calculating impact ratios for various demographic categories such as sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectional categories. Here are the key requirements and considerations:

### Requirements for Calculating Impact Ratios

1. **Data Collection**:
   - **Demographic Data**: Collect data on the demographic characteristics of applicants, including sex, race/ethnicity, and any intersectional categories (e.g., race and gender combined).
   - **Outcome Data**: Gather data on the outcomes of the AEDT, such as hiring rates, promotion rates, or any other relevant decision-making outcomes.

2. **Define Impact Ratio**:
   - The impact ratio is typically calculated as the ratio of the selection rate for a specific demographic group to the selection rate for a reference group (often the group with the highest selection rate).
   - Formula: 
     \[
     \text{Impact Ratio} = \frac{\text{Selection Rate of Group A}}{\text{Selection Rate of Reference Group}}
     \]

3. **Selection Rate Calculation**:
   - Calculate the selection rate for each demographic group by dividing the number of individuals selected by the total number of individuals in that group.

4. **Intersectional Analysis**:
   - For intersectional categories, calculate the selection rates for each combination of demographic characteristics (e.g., Black women, Hispanic men) to assess the impact on these specific groups.

### Criteria for Excluding Certain Categories

1. **Sample Size**:
   - Exclude categories with insufficient sample sizes to ensure statistical validity. A common threshold is a minimum number of individuals (e.g., 30) in each category to avoid unreliable estimates.

2. **Data Quality**:
   - Exclude categories with poor data quality or missing data that could skew results. Ensure that the data is complete and accurately reflects the demographic groups.

3. **Relevance**:
   - Consider excluding categories that are not relevant to the analysis or that do not have a meaningful impact on the outcomes being studied.

4. **Legal and Ethical Considerations**:
   - Be aware of any legal requirements or ethical guidelines that may dictate which categories must be included or excluded in the analysis.

5. **Statistical Significance**:
   - Exclude categories that do not show statistically significant differences in outcomes compared to the reference group, as these may not provide meaningful insights.

### Additional Considerations

- **Contextual Factors**: Consider external factors that may influence outcomes, such as economic conditions or industry-specific trends.
- **Transparency**: Document the rationale for including or excluding certain categories to ensure transparency in the audit process.
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Involve stakeholders in the audit process to gather diverse perspectives and ensure that the analysis is comprehensive.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively conduct a bias audit for an AEDT and calculate impact ratios that provide insights into potential biases in the decision-making process.",False,"The agent's answer provides detailed steps and considerations for conducting a bias audit, but it does not directly address the minimum requirements for calculating the impact ratio and selection rates as specified in the ground truth. It also lacks mention of the need to indicate the number of individuals excluded due to unknown categories.",0.9411764705882352,0.8234801888465881,5.0,"The generated answer comprehensively addresses all components of the user query, providing detailed requirements for calculating impact ratios and criteria for excluding categories, all of which are factually accurate."
"Why is a bias audit necessary for an AEDT, and what are the minimum requirements for conducting a bias audit?","The purpose of a bias audit for an AEDT is to calculate the selection rate and impact ratio for each category, including sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories. It ensures that the AEDT does not discriminate based on these categories and that the calculations are performed for each group if the AEDT classifies candidates into specified groups.","Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall

### Importance of a Bias Audit

1. **Fairness and Equity**: AEDTs can inadvertently perpetuate or exacerbate existing biases in data, leading to unfair treatment of individuals or groups. A bias audit helps identify and mitigate these biases.

2. **Transparency**: Conducting a bias audit promotes transparency in how decisions are made by the AEDT, which is crucial for building trust among users and stakeholders.

3. **Compliance**: Many jurisdictions are implementing regulations that require organizations to assess and mitigate bias in their algorithms. A bias audit helps ensure compliance with these legal requirements.

4. **Performance Improvement**: Identifying biases can lead to improvements in the model's performance, making it more accurate and reliable.

5. **Reputation Management**: Organizations that proactively address bias can enhance their reputation and avoid potential backlash from stakeholders or the public.

### Minimum Requirements for Conducting a Bias Audit

1. **Data Assessment**:
   - **Data Collection**: Ensure that the data used for training and testing the AEDT is representative of the population it serves.
   - **Data Quality**: Evaluate the quality of the data, including completeness, accuracy, and relevance.

2. **Bias Identification**:
   - **Metric Selection**: Define appropriate metrics to measure bias, such as disparate impact, equal opportunity, or predictive parity.
   - **Statistical Analysis**: Use statistical methods to analyze the outcomes of the AEDT across different demographic groups.

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - **Performance Metrics**: Assess the model's performance using fairness metrics alongside traditional accuracy metrics.
   - **Scenario Testing**: Conduct scenario-based testing to evaluate how the AEDT performs under various conditions and for different groups.

4. **Documentation**:
   - **Audit Report**: Document the findings of the bias audit, including identified biases, methodologies used, and recommendations for mitigation.
   - **Transparency**: Make the audit results accessible to stakeholders to promote transparency.

5. **Mitigation Strategies**:
   - **Bias Mitigation Techniques**: Implement strategies to reduce identified biases, such as re-sampling, re-weighting, or algorithmic adjustments.
   - **Continuous Monitoring**: Establish a process for ongoing monitoring and re-evaluation of the AEDT to ensure that biases are continually addressed.

6. **Stakeholder Engagement**:
   - **Involvement of Diverse Perspectives**: Engage stakeholders from diverse backgrounds in the audit process to gain insights and ensure that various viewpoints are considered.

7. **Compliance with Standards**:
   - **Adherence to Guidelines**: Follow established guidelines and best practices for bias auditing, such as those from relevant regulatory bodies or industry standards.

By adhering to these minimum requirements, organizations can conduct effective bias audits that help ensure their AEDTs operate fairly and responsibly.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed explanation of the importance and requirements for conducting a bias audit, but it does not address the specific purpose of calculating selection rates and impact ratios for categories like sex and race/ethnicity as stated in the ground truth.",0.1612903225806451,0.8950444459915161,5.0,"The generated answer thoroughly addresses the necessity of a bias audit for an AEDT and outlines comprehensive minimum requirements, aligning closely with the reference answer without any factual inaccuracies."

2. **Federal Courts**: If the civil penalty arises from a federal law or regulation, it may be returnable in federal court.

3. **Administrative Agencies**: Some civil penalties are handled by administrative agencies, which may have their own procedures for adjudicating such matters.

4. **Local Courts**: In some cases, local or municipal courts may have jurisdiction, especially for penalties related to local ordinances.

Section 1.  Chapter 5 of Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York is amended to add Subchapter T to read 
as follows: 
Subchapter T: Automated Employment Decision Tools 
§ 5-300. Definitions. 
As used in this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings: 
 
Automated Employment Decision Tool. “Automated employment decision tool” or “AEDT” means 
“Automated employment decision tool” as defined by § 20-870 of the Code where the phrase “to 
substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making” means: 
i. 
to rely solely on a simplified output (score, tag, classification, ranking, etc.), with no other 
factors considered; or 
ii. 
 to use a simplified output as one of a set of criteria where the simplified output is weighted 
more than any other criterion in the set; or   
iii. 
to use a simplified output to overrule conclusions derived from other factors including 
human decision-making.  
  
Bias Audit. “Bias audit” means “Bias audit” as defined by § 20-870 of the Code.  
 
Candidate for Employment. “Candidate for employment” means a person who has applied for a specific 
employment position by submitting the necessary information or items in the format required by the 
employer or employment agency.  
 
Category. “Category” means any component 1 category required to be reported by employers pursuant 
to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States Code as specified in part 1602.7 of 
title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, as designated on the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission Employer Information Report EEO-1. 
 
Code. “Code” means the Administrative Code of the City of New York. 
 
Distribution Date. “Distribution date” means the date the employer or employment agency began using 
a specific AEDT.  
 
Employment Decision. “Employment decision” means “Employment decision” as defined by § 20-870 
of the Code. 
 
Employment Agency. “Employment agency” means “Employment agency” as defined by 6 RCNY § 5-
249.  
 
Historical data.",[],"{'question_type': 'simple', 'seed_document_id': 0, 'topic': 'Enforcement and Penalties', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","An **automated employment decision tool** (AEDT) refers to any software or algorithmic system used to assist in making employment-related decisions. This can include tools for screening resumes, assessing candidates through tests, predicting job performance, or even making hiring, promotion, or termination decisions. 

These tools often utilize data analytics, machine learning, or artificial intelligence to evaluate candidates based on various criteria, such as skills, experience, and fit for the role. While they can enhance efficiency and reduce bias in some cases, they also raise concerns about transparency, fairness, and potential discrimination if not designed and implemented carefully. 

In some jurisdictions, there are regulations governing the use of AEDTs to ensure they comply with anti-discrimination laws and promote fair hiring practices.",False,"The agent's answer provides a general definition of an automated employment decision tool but lacks specific details about the computational processes and the nature of the output (e.g., score, classification, recommendation) as mentioned in the ground truth. Additionally, it does not emphasize the aspect of substantially assisting or replacing discretionary decision-making.",0.3888888888888889,0.8378612399101257,4.0,"The generated answer provides a comprehensive definition of an automated employment decision tool, covering its purpose and implications, but it lacks the specific mention of ""simplified output"" and the emphasis on ""substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making"" found in the reference answer."
What must a bias audit of an AEDT calculate?,"A bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate and impact ratio for each category, including sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race. It must also indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT that fall within an unknown category.","Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum:

ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for

for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Here are the main components that should be included:

1. **Disparity Metrics**: Calculate metrics that assess disparities in outcomes across different demographic groups (e.g., race, gender, age). Common metrics include:
   - **False Positive Rate**: The rate at which individuals from a specific group are incorrectly classified as positive.
   - **False Negative Rate**: The rate at which individuals from a specific group are incorrectly classified as negative.
   - **Predictive Parity**: The degree to which the predicted outcomes are equally accurate across groups.

2. **Calibration**: Assess whether the predicted probabilities of outcomes are calibrated across different demographic groups. This involves checking if the predicted probabilities correspond to actual outcomes.

3. **Impact Analysis**: Evaluate the potential impact of the AEDT on different groups. This can include:
   - **Outcome Disparities**: Analyzing how different groups are affected by the decisions made by the AEDT.
   - **Economic Impact**: Estimating the economic consequences of biased decisions on affected groups.

4. **Feature Importance Analysis**: Determine which features (inputs) are most influential in the decision-making process and assess whether any of these features correlate with protected characteristics (e.g., race, gender).

5. **Sensitivity Analysis**: Test how changes in input data or model parameters affect outcomes, particularly for different demographic groups.

6. **Audit Trail**: Maintain a record of the audit process, including methodologies, data sources, and findings, to ensure transparency and accountability.

7. **Stakeholder Feedback**: Incorporate feedback from affected communities and stakeholders to understand the real-world implications of the AEDT's decisions.

8. **Compliance with Regulations**: Ensure that the AEDT complies with relevant laws and regulations regarding fairness and non-discrimination.

By conducting these calculations and assessments, a bias audit can help identify and mitigate potential biases in AEDTs, promoting fairness and equity in automated decision-making processes.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed overview of various components of a bias audit but does not specifically mention the selection rate, impact ratio, or the need to indicate the number of individuals in unknown categories, which are key elements of the ground truth.",0.21875,0.8667564392089844,3.0,The generated answer provides a comprehensive overview of various components relevant to a bias audit of an AEDT but does not specifically mention the required calculations of selection rate and impact ratio for demographic categories as outlined in the reference answer.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.

these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'simple', 'seed_document_id': 11, 'topic': 'Definitions', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","A bias audit for an Automated Decision-Making Tool (AEDT) serves several important purposes:

1. **Identifying Bias**: The primary goal is to detect any biases in the algorithms or data that could lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes. This includes examining how different demographic groups are affected by the decisions made by the AEDT.

2. **Ensuring Fairness**: By identifying biases, organizations can take steps to ensure that their AEDTs operate fairly across all user groups, promoting equity and reducing the risk of perpetuating existing inequalities.

3. **Enhancing Transparency**: A bias audit can help make the decision-making processes of AEDTs more transparent. This transparency is crucial for building trust among users and stakeholders.

4. **Compliance and Accountability**: Many jurisdictions have regulations regarding the use of AI and automated decision-making. A bias audit can help organizations comply with these regulations and demonstrate accountability in their use of technology.

5. **Improving Model Performance**: Identifying and addressing biases can lead to improved overall performance of the AEDT, as it may enhance the accuracy and reliability of the decisions made.

6. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Conducting a bias audit can involve engaging with various stakeholders, including affected communities, which can provide valuable insights and foster collaboration.

7. **Continuous Improvement**: Bias audits can be part of a broader strategy for continuous monitoring and improvement of AEDTs, ensuring that they adapt to changing societal norms and values.

Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.  
 
 
 
    _________selection rate for a category________

Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer

New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection 
 
Notice of Adoption of Final Rule 
 
Pursuant to the authority vested in the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection by 
Sections 1043 and 2203(f) of the New York City Charter and Section 20-104(b) of the New York City 
Administrative Code, and in accordance with the requirements of Section 1043 of the New York City Charter, 
the Department amends Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York.  
 
An initial version of this rule was proposed and published on September 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on 
November 4, 2022, and comments regarding the rule were received. DCWP proposed a second version of this 
rule on December 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on January 23, 2023, and comments regarding the rule 
were received.  
 
Statement of Basis and Purpose 
 
The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP” or “Department”) is adding rules to implement 
new legislation regarding automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”). Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits 
employers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has 
been subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly 
available, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   
 
These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of

calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'simple', 'seed_document_id': 15, 'topic': 'Metrics/Data', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","In a bias audit, particularly when assessing the impact ratio, several calculations and considerations are typically involved. The impact ratio is often used to evaluate the effectiveness and fairness of a system, such as an algorithm or a hiring process, in terms of its outcomes across different demographic groups. Here are the key calculations and steps involved:

### 1. **Define the Groups**
   - Identify the demographic groups you want to analyze (e.g., gender, race, age).

### 2. **Collect Data**
   - Gather data on the outcomes for each group. This could include hiring rates, promotion rates, or any other relevant metrics.

### 3. **Calculate Outcomes for Each Group**
   - For each group, calculate the total number of individuals and the number of successful outcomes.
   - Example:
     - Group A: 100 applicants, 30 hired
     - Group B: 100 applicants, 10 hired

### 4. **Calculate Success Rates**
   - Calculate the success rate for each group:
     \[
     \text{Success Rate} = \frac{\text{Number of Successful Outcomes}}{\text{Total Number of Individuals}}
     \]
   - Continuing the example:
     - Group A Success Rate: \( \frac{30}{100} = 0.30 \)
     - Group B Success Rate: \( \frac{10}{100} = 0.10 \)

### 5. **Calculate the Impact Ratio**
   - The impact ratio compares the success rates of different groups:
     \[
     \text{Impact Ratio} = \frac{\text{Success Rate of Group A}}{\text{Success Rate of Group B}}
     \]
   - Using the previous success rates:
     \[
     \text{Impact Ratio} = \frac{0.30}{0.10} = 3.0
     \]
   - An impact ratio of 1 indicates equal outcomes, while values greater than 1 indicate a favorable outcome for Group A compared to Group B.

### 6. **Interpret the Results**
   - Analyze the impact ratio in the context of fairness and equity. A significantly higher or lower impact ratio may indicate bias in the system.

### 7. **Statistical Significance**
   - Consider conducting statistical tests (e.g., chi-square tests) to determine if the differences in success rates are statistically significant.

### 8. **Adjust for Confounding Variables**
   - If applicable, adjust for other variables that might affect outcomes (e.g., experience, education) to ensure that the impact ratio reflects true bias rather than differences in qualifications.

### 9. **Report Findings**
   - Document the findings, including the impact ratios for all groups analyzed, and provide recommendations for addressing any identified biases.

### Conclusion
The calculations involved in a bias audit for the impact ratio focus on comparing success rates across demographic groups to identify potential disparities. It’s essential to approach this analysis with a clear understanding of the context and the implications of the findings.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed process for calculating the impact ratio but does not specifically mention the required calculations for different demographic categories as outlined in the ground truth.

6. **Stakeholder Relevance**: If stakeholders have indicated that a category is not relevant to their interests or concerns, it may be excluded.

7. **Temporal Factors**: Categories that are only relevant for a specific time period or event may be excluded from ongoing calculations.

8. **Duplication**: If a category overlaps significantly with another already included, it may be excluded to avoid double counting.

What are the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT?,"A bias audit of an AEDT must, at a minimum, calculate the selection rate for each category, calculate the impact ratio for each category, ensure that the calculations separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories, and indicate the number of individuals not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category.","Document 14: Data 
on those individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
(c) Where an AEDT scores candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion, a bias 
audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the median score for the full sample of applicants;  
(2) Calculate the scoring rate for individuals in each category;

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;",[],"{'question_type': 'simple', 'seed_document_id': 14, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","Conducting a bias audit of an Automated Decision-Making Tool (AEDT) involves several key requirements to ensure a comprehensive evaluation. Here are the main components:

1. **Data Collection**:
   - **Diverse Data Sources**: Gather data from various sources to ensure representation across different demographics (e.g., race, gender, age).
   - **Quality of Data**: Ensure the data is accurate, complete, and relevant to the decision-making process.

2. **Transparency**:
   - **Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation of the AEDT's design, algorithms, and decision-making processes.
   - **Access to Information**: Provide stakeholders with access to information about how the AEDT operates and the data it uses.

3. **Stakeholder Engagement**:
   - **Involve Diverse Stakeholders**: Engage with a range of stakeholders, including affected communities, to gather insights and concerns.
   - **Feedback Mechanisms**: Establish channels for ongoing feedback from users and those impacted by the AEDT.

4. **Bias Identification**:
   - **Statistical Analysis**: Use statistical methods to identify potential biases in the data and outcomes produced by the AEDT.
   - **Comparative Analysis**: Compare outcomes across different demographic groups to assess fairness and equity.

5. **Algorithm Evaluation**:
   - **Model Testing**: Test the algorithm under various scenarios to identify any biased outcomes.
   - **Sensitivity Analysis**: Analyze how changes in input data affect the outcomes to understand the robustness of the model.

6. **Mitigation Strategies**:
   - **Bias Mitigation Techniques**: Implement strategies to reduce identified biases, such as re-weighting data or adjusting algorithms.
   - **Continuous Monitoring**: Establish a framework for ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the AEDT to ensure it remains fair over time.

7. **Reporting**:
   - **Comprehensive Reporting**: Prepare a detailed report outlining the findings of the bias audit, including identified biases, methodologies used, and recommendations for improvement.
   - **Public Disclosure**: Consider making the audit results publicly available to promote transparency and accountability.

8. **Compliance and Ethical Standards**:
   - **Adhere to Regulations**: Ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations regarding data protection and anti-discrimination.
   - **Ethical Guidelines**: Follow ethical guidelines for AI and machine learning to promote fairness and accountability.

9. **Interdisciplinary Approach**:
   - **Collaboration with Experts**: Involve experts from various fields (e.g., data science, ethics, law) to provide a well-rounded perspective on the audit process.

10. **Training and Awareness**:
    - **Educate Stakeholders**: Provide training for stakeholders on the importance of bias audits and how to interpret the results.

By addressing these requirements, organizations can conduct thorough bias audits of AEDTs, helping to ensure that these tools operate fairly and equitably.",False,"The agent's answer provides a comprehensive overview of requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT, but it does not specifically mention the calculation of selection rates, impact ratios, or the need to separately assess impacts on sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectional categories, which are key elements in the ground truth answer.",0.225,0.8962829113006592,2.0,"The generated answer provides a comprehensive overview of bias audit requirements but fails to specifically address the key components mentioned in the reference answer, such as calculating selection rates and impact ratios for specific categories."

Document 0: Subchapter 25: Automated Employment Decision Tools
§ 20-870 Definitions.
For the purposes of this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings:
   Automated employment decision tool. The term ""automated employment decision tool"" means any computational process, derived from machine
learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence, that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation,
that is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons. The term
""automated employment decision tool"" does not include a tool that does not automate, support, substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-
making processes and that does not materially impact natural persons, including, but not limited to, a junk email filter, firewall, antivirus software,
calculator, spreadsheet, database, data set, or other compilation of data.
   Bias audit. The term ""bias audit"" means an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor. Such bias audit shall include but not be limited to the
testing of an automated employment decision tool to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported
by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of
federal regulations.
   Employment decision. The term ""employment decision"" means to screen candidates for employment or employees for promotion within the city.
(L.L. 2021/144, 12/11/2021, eff. 1/1/2023)
§ 20-871 Requirements for automated employment decision tools.
   a.   In the city, it shall be unlawful for an employer or an employment agency to use an automated employment decision tool to screen a candidate or
employee for an employment decision unless:
      1.   Such tool has been the subject of a bias audit conducted no more than one year prior to the use of such tool; and
      2.   A summary of the results of the most recent bias audit of such tool as well as the distribution date of the tool to which such audit applies has been
made publicly available on the website of the employer or employment agency prior to the use of such tool.
   b.   Notices required.",[],"{'question_type': 'simple', 'seed_document_id': 23, 'topic': 'Definitions', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","A bias audit for automated employment decision tools serves several important purposes:

1. **Identify Discrimination**: It helps uncover any biases in the algorithms that may lead to discriminatory outcomes based on race, gender, age, or other protected characteristics.

2. **Ensure Fairness**: By assessing the fairness of the decision-making processes, organizations can ensure that their hiring practices are equitable and do not disadvantage certain groups.

3. **Compliance with Regulations**: Many jurisdictions have laws and regulations regarding fair hiring practices. A bias audit can help organizations comply with these legal requirements and avoid potential lawsuits.

4. **Enhance Transparency**: Auditing can provide insights into how decisions are made by automated tools, promoting transparency in the hiring process.

5. **Improve Algorithm Performance**: Identifying biases can lead to improvements in the algorithms themselves, making them more effective and reliable in predicting candidate success.

6. **Build Trust**: Conducting bias audits can enhance trust among job seekers and employees, showing that the organization is committed to fair and equitable hiring practices.

7. **Promote Diversity and Inclusion**: By addressing biases, organizations can foster a more diverse and inclusive workforce, which can lead to better business outcomes.

8. **Continuous Improvement**: Regular audits can help organizations monitor and refine their automated tools over time, ensuring they adapt to changing societal norms and expectations regarding fairness and equity.

Overall, bias audits are a critical step in ensuring that automated employment decision tools contribute positively to the hiring process rather than perpetuating existing biases.",False,"The agent's answer provides a comprehensive overview of the purposes of a bias audit but does not specifically address the ground truth, which emphasizes assessing the tool's disparate impact on specific categories required to be reported by employers.",0.7857142857142857,1.0,4.0,"The generated answer comprehensively addresses the purpose of a bias audit for automated employment decision tools, covering multiple relevant aspects, but it does not explicitly mention the assessment of disparate impact on specific categories as highlighted in the reference answer."
What are the requirements for the published results of the bias audit?,The requirements for the published results of the required bias audit are clarified in the new rules. These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category that is required to be reported to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to determine an impact ratio.,"Document 9: 4 
 
iii. 
at any point during the bias audit, has a direct financial interest or a material indirect 
financial interest in an employer or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to 
use the  AEDT or in a vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT. 
 
Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.  
 
 
 
    _________selection rate for a category________  
Impact Ratio =        selection rate of the most selected category  
 
OR 
 
  
 
     ______scoring rate for a category__________  
Impact Ratio =        scoring rate of the highest scoring category 
 
 
Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;",[],"{'question_type': 'simple', 'seed_document_id': 9, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","The requirements for the published results of a bias audit can vary depending on the specific context, regulatory framework, and the organization conducting the audit. However, some common requirements typically include:

1. **Transparency**: The methodology used for the audit should be clearly outlined, including data sources, algorithms, and any assumptions made.

2. **Comprehensive Reporting**: Results should cover various dimensions of bias, such as demographic factors (e.g., race, gender, age) and the impact of these biases on outcomes.

3. **Statistical Rigor**: The findings should be supported by robust statistical analysis, including confidence intervals, significance testing, and potential limitations of the data.

4. **Actionable Insights**: Recommendations for mitigating identified biases should be included, along with strategies for ongoing monitoring and evaluation.

5. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Involvement of affected communities or stakeholders in the audit process and in interpreting the results can enhance credibility and relevance.

6. **Compliance with Regulations**: Adherence to any relevant legal or regulatory requirements regarding data privacy, fairness, and accountability.

7. **Accessibility**: The results should be presented in a format that is understandable to a broad audience, including non-technical stakeholders.

8. **Follow-up Mechanisms**: Plans for follow-up audits or assessments to track progress on addressing identified biases should be outlined.

9. **Ethical Considerations**: A discussion of ethical implications and considerations related to the findings and recommendations.

10. **Publication and Dissemination**: Clear plans for how and where the results will be published and disseminated to ensure wide accessibility.

These requirements aim to ensure that bias audits are conducted rigorously and that their findings are useful for improving fairness and accountability in systems and processes.",False,"The agent's answer provides a general overview of bias audit requirements but does not address the specific requirements outlined in the ground truth, which focuses on the calculation of selection rates for race/ethnicity and sex categories in relation to EEOC reporting.",0.2258064516129032,0.9788717031478882,2.0,"The generated answer provides a broad overview of bias audit requirements but fails to address the specific requirements outlined in the reference answer, leading to significant inaccuracies regarding the selection rates and impact ratios."

"What are the specific calculations and requirements for conducting a bias audit of an AEDT, including the categories that need to be considered and the conditions under which historical data or test data can be used?","The minimum requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT are: calculating the selection rate and impact ratio for each category, including sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race; performing these calculations for each group if the AEDT classifies candidates into specified groups; and indicating the number of individuals not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category.","Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex', 'seed_document_id': 11, 'topic': 'Metrics/Data', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","Conducting a bias audit of an Automated Decision-Making Tool (AEDT) involves a systematic approach to evaluate the fairness and equity of the tool's outputs. Here are the specific calculations, requirements, and categories to consider, along with conditions for using historical or test data:

### 1. **Define Objectives and Scope**
   - **Objective**: Determine what biases you are looking to identify (e.g., racial, gender, socioeconomic).
   - **Scope**: Specify the context in which the AEDT is used (e.g., hiring, lending, law enforcement).

### 2. **Data Collection**
   - **Historical Data**: Use past data that reflects the decisions made by the AEDT. Ensure it is representative of the population affected.
   - **Test Data**: Create or use synthetic datasets to simulate various scenarios and assess the AEDT's performance across different groups.

### 3. **Categories to Consider**
   - **Protected Attributes**: Identify attributes such as race, gender, age, disability, and socioeconomic status.
   - **Outcome Metrics**: Define what constitutes a ""successful"" or ""unfavorable"" outcome based on the AEDT's purpose.
   - **Group Comparisons**: Analyze outcomes across different demographic groups.

### 4. **Calculations for Bias Detection**
   - **Disparate Impact Ratio**: Calculate the ratio of favorable outcomes for different groups. A ratio below 0.8 may indicate potential bias.
   - **Equal Opportunity Metrics**: Assess true positive rates and false positive rates across groups.
   - **Calibration**: Check if predicted probabilities of outcomes are consistent across groups.
   - **Statistical Parity**: Evaluate if the decision rates are similar across groups.
   - **Predictive Parity**: Compare the accuracy of predictions across different demographic groups.

### 5. **Statistical Tests**
   - **Chi-Squared Test**: For categorical outcomes, to test if distributions differ significantly across groups.
   - **T-tests or ANOVA**: For continuous outcomes, to compare means across groups.
   - **Regression Analysis**: To control for confounding variables and assess the impact of protected attributes on outcomes.

### 6. **Conditions for Data Use**
   - **Historical Data**: Must be relevant and representative of the current population. Ensure it is free from historical biases that could skew results.
   - **Test Data**: Should be designed to cover a range of scenarios and demographic groups. It should not be biased or overly simplistic.
   - **Data Privacy**: Ensure compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) when using personal data.

### 7. **Documentation and Reporting**
   - **Audit Report**: Document findings, methodologies, and any identified biases. Include recommendations for mitigation.
   - **Stakeholder Engagement**: Involve affected communities and stakeholders in the audit process to gather insights and feedback.

### 8. **Mitigation Strategies**
   - **Model Adjustments**: Consider re-training the model with adjusted weights or using fairness constraints.
   - **Transparency**: Provide clear explanations of how decisions are made by the AEDT.
   - **Continuous Monitoring**: Establish ongoing audits to ensure the AEDT remains fair over time.

Conducting a bias audit of an AEDT is a complex but essential process to ensure fairness and equity in automated decision-making. By following these guidelines, organizations can identify and mitigate biases, leading to more equitable outcomes.",False,"The agent's answer provides a comprehensive overview of conducting a bias audit of an AEDT but does not specifically address the minimum requirements as outlined in the ground truth.

Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate),

Example.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex', 'seed_document_id': 10, 'topic': 'Definitions', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","**Impact Ratio** is a statistical measure used to assess the effect of a particular selection process on different demographic groups. It is often used in the context of employment practices to evaluate whether a selection method (like hiring or promotion) disproportionately affects different groups based on characteristics such as race, gender, or age.

### Definition:
The Impact Ratio is defined as the ratio of the selection rate (or scoring rate) of a minority group to the selection rate of a majority group. It helps to identify potential adverse impact in selection processes.

### Calculation:
1. **Determine Selection Rates**:
   - **Selection Rate for Majority Group (SR_M)**: This is calculated as the number of individuals selected from the majority group divided by the total number of individuals in that group.
   - **Selection Rate for Minority Group (SR_m)**: This is calculated as the number of individuals selected from the minority group divided by the total number of individuals in that group.

2. **Calculate Impact Ratio**:
   \[
   \text{Impact Ratio} = \frac{\text{SR}_m}{\text{SR}_M}
   \]

### Interpretation:
- An Impact Ratio of **1.0** indicates that the selection rates for both groups are equal, suggesting no adverse impact.
- An Impact Ratio **less than 1.0** indicates that the minority group has a lower selection rate compared to the majority group, suggesting potential adverse impact.
- An Impact Ratio **greater than 1.0** indicates that the minority group has a higher selection rate compared to the majority group.

### Example:
- If the selection rate for a majority group is 80% (0.80) and for a minority group is 50% (0.50), the Impact Ratio would be:
  \[
  \text{Impact Ratio} = \frac{0.50}{0.80} = 0.625
  \]
This indicates that the minority group is selected at a rate that is 62.5% of the majority group's selection rate, suggesting potential adverse impact.

### Conclusion:
The Impact Ratio is a valuable tool for organizations to evaluate their selection processes and ensure fairness and equity in hiring and promotion practices.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed explanation of the Impact Ratio but does not align with the ground truth, which states that it can be calculated as the selection rate for a category divided by the selection rate of the most selected category, or as the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the highest scoring category.",0.8421052631578947,0.8904818296432495,4.0,"The generated answer provides a comprehensive definition and calculation method for the Impact Ratio, addressing the user query well, but it does not explicitly mention the alternative calculation method involving the highest scoring category as noted in the reference answer."

What is the difference between historical data and test data in the context of conducting a bias audit for an AEDT?,'Test data' refers to data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.,"Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application

Here’s a breakdown of their differences:

### Historical Data
- **Definition**: Historical data refers to the data that has been collected over time and reflects past decisions, outcomes, and behaviors. This data is often used to train machine learning models or to understand trends and patterns.
- **Purpose**: In a bias audit, historical data is used to assess how the AEDT has performed in the past. It helps identify any biases that may have been present in the decision-making process and how those biases may have affected outcomes.
- **Characteristics**: This data typically includes real-world examples and may contain inherent biases that existed at the time the data was collected. It reflects the societal context and conditions under which decisions were made.

### Test Data
- **Definition**: Test data is a separate dataset that is specifically created or selected to evaluate the performance of the AEDT. It is often used to simulate how the model would perform on new, unseen data.
- **Purpose**: In a bias audit, test data is used to assess the AEDT's performance in a controlled manner. It helps determine whether the model exhibits bias when applied to new cases and can be used to validate the findings from the historical data analysis.
- **Characteristics**: Test data is usually designed to be representative of the population the AEDT will serve, but it may be curated to include specific scenarios or demographic groups to evaluate potential biases. It should ideally be free from the biases present in historical data to provide a clearer picture of the AEDT's performance.

### Summary
- **Historical Data**: Reflects past decisions and outcomes, often containing inherent biases; used to analyze how the AEDT has performed historically.
- **Test Data**: A curated dataset used to evaluate the AEDT's performance on new cases; helps assess potential biases in a controlled environment.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex', 'seed_document_id': 11, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","Conducting a bias audit for an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT) involves several key requirements and considerations. Here’s a general outline of what is typically needed:

### Requirements for Conducting a Bias Audit:

1. **Data Collection**:
   - **Diverse Data Sets**: Collect data that reflects a diverse range of candidates, including various demographics (e.g., race, gender, age).
   - **Historical Data**: Ideally, historical hiring data should be used to assess the performance of the AEDT over time.

2. **Transparency**:
   - **Algorithm Disclosure**: Understand and document how the AEDT operates, including the algorithms and criteria it uses for decision-making.
   - **Model Interpretability**: Ensure that the model's decisions can be interpreted and explained.

3. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - **Fairness Metrics**: Use appropriate metrics to evaluate bias, such as disparate impact, equal opportunity, and predictive parity.
   - **Performance Metrics**: Assess the overall performance of the AEDT in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall.

4. **Testing and Validation**:
   - **Simulations**: Run simulations to see how the AEDT performs under different scenarios and with different demographic groups.
   - **Cross-Validation**: Use techniques like cross-validation to ensure the robustness of the findings.

5. **Stakeholder Involvement**:
   - **Engagement**: Involve stakeholders, including legal, HR, and diversity teams, to ensure a comprehensive approach to bias auditing.

6. **Documentation and Reporting**:
   - **Audit Report**: Document findings, methodologies, and recommendations for mitigating bias.
   - **Action Plan**: Develop a plan for addressing any identified biases.

### Use of Test Data for Bias Audit:

If there is insufficient historical data available, employers or employment agencies may use test data for the bias audit. However, there are important considerations:

- **Relevance**: The test data should be representative of the population that the AEDT will be applied to in real-world scenarios.
- **Ethical Considerations**: Ensure that the use of test data does not inadvertently introduce bias or misrepresent the candidate pool.
- **Validation**: Any findings from the test data should be validated against real-world outcomes once sufficient historical data becomes available.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensure that the use of test data complies with any relevant laws and regulations regarding employment practices and data usage.

In summary, while using test data can be a viable option in the absence of historical data, it is crucial to approach this method carefully to ensure that the audit results are valid and actionable.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed overview of the requirements for conducting a bias audit for an AEDT but does not address the specific purpose of the audit as stated in the ground truth, which focuses on calculating selection rates and impact ratios for different demographic categories.",0.1142857142857142,0.8576427698135376,4.0,"The generated answer comprehensively addresses the requirements for conducting a bias audit for an AEDT and correctly discusses the use of test data, with only minor omissions in detail compared to the reference answer."

New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection 
 
Notice of Adoption of Final Rule 
 
Pursuant to the authority vested in the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection by 
Sections 1043 and 2203(f) of the New York City Charter and Section 20-104(b) of the New York City 
Administrative Code, and in accordance with the requirements of Section 1043 of the New York City Charter, 
the Department amends Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York.  
 
An initial version of this rule was proposed and published on September 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on 
November 4, 2022, and comments regarding the rule were received. DCWP proposed a second version of this 
rule on December 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on January 23, 2023, and comments regarding the rule 
were received.  
 
Statement of Basis and Purpose 
 
The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP” or “Department”) is adding rules to implement 
new legislation regarding automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”). Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits 
employers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has 
been subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly 
available, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   
 
These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

This can involve analyzing data sets, decision-making processes, and the impact of automated systems on different demographic groups.

The goal of a bias audit is to ensure fairness, accountability, and transparency in the use of technology, particularly in areas like hiring, lending, law enforcement, and other sectors where biased outcomes can have significant consequences.

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex', 'seed_document_id': 15, 'topic': 'Metrics/Data', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","Conducting a bias audit of an Automated Decision-Making Tool (AEDT) involves a systematic approach to evaluate its fairness and identify any potential biases in its outputs. Here are the steps and criteria for conducting such an audit, including the calculation of impact ratios for various demographic categories:

### Steps for Conducting a Bias Audit

1. **Define Objectives and Scope**
   - Determine the purpose of the audit (e.g., compliance, ethical considerations).
   - Identify the specific AEDT to be audited and its intended use.

2. **Gather Data**
   - Collect data used by the AEDT, including input features and output decisions.
   - Ensure the dataset is representative of the population it serves.

3. **Identify Protected Attributes**
   - Determine which demographic categories are relevant for the audit (e.g., sex, race/ethnicity, age, disability status).
   - Consider intersectional categories (e.g., race and gender combined).

4. **Establish Baseline Metrics**
   - Define key performance indicators (KPIs) for the AEDT, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
   - Establish baseline metrics for different demographic groups.

5. **Calculate Impact Ratios**
   - **Impact Ratio Calculation**: For each demographic group, calculate the impact ratio using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Impact Ratio} = \frac{\text{Outcome Rate for Group}}{\text{Outcome Rate for Reference Group}}
     \]
   - **Outcome Rate**: This could be the proportion of positive outcomes (e.g., approvals, recommendations) for each group.
   - **Reference Group**: Typically, this is the group with the highest outcome rate or the majority group.

6. **Analyze Disparities**
   - Compare impact ratios across different demographic groups.
   - Identify any significant disparities that indicate potential bias.

7. **Statistical Testing**
   - Conduct statistical tests (e.g., Chi-square tests, t-tests) to determine if observed disparities are statistically significant.
   - Use confidence intervals to assess the reliability of the impact ratios.

8. **Review Model Interpretability**
   - Analyze the model's decision-making process to understand how different features contribute to outcomes.
   - Use techniques like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) or LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) for interpretability.

9. **Engage Stakeholders**
   - Involve stakeholders (e.g., affected communities, domain experts) in the audit process to gather insights and perspectives.
   - Discuss findings and implications with relevant parties.

10. **Develop Recommendations**

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates).

for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex', 'seed_document_id': 11, 'topic': 'Metrics/Data', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","Conducting a bias audit of an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT) for candidate selection or promotion involves several specific calculations and analyses to ensure fairness and equity in the decision-making process. Here are the key calculations and categories that should be separately assessed:

### Key Calculations

1. **Disparate Impact Analysis**:
   - **Selection Rates**: Calculate the selection rates for different demographic groups (e.g., race, gender, age).
   - **Impact Ratio**: Compute the impact ratio by dividing the selection rate of the protected group by the selection rate of the majority group. An impact ratio below 0.8 may indicate potential bias.

2. **Statistical Significance Testing**:
   - **Chi-Square Test**: Use this test to determine if there are significant differences in selection rates between groups.
   - **Z-Test for Proportions**: Assess whether the differences in selection rates are statistically significant.

3. **Regression Analysis**:
   - **Logistic Regression**: Analyze the relationship between candidate characteristics and selection outcomes while controlling for other variables. This helps identify if certain demographics are unfairly disadvantaged.
   - **Coefficient Analysis**: Examine the coefficients for demographic variables to assess their impact on selection outcomes.

4. **Predictive Validity**:
   - **Correlation Coefficients**: Measure the correlation between AEDT scores and actual job performance to ensure that the tool is valid and predictive of success.
   - **Discrimination Ratio**: Evaluate how well the AEDT predicts performance across different demographic groups.

5. **False Positive/Negative Rates**:
   - **Confusion Matrix**: Create a confusion matrix to calculate false positive and false negative rates for different demographic groups.

6. **Calibration**:
   - **Calibration Curves**: Assess whether the predicted probabilities of success align with actual outcomes across demographic groups.

### Categories for Separate Analysis

1. **Demographic Groups**:
   - **Race/Ethnicity**: Analyze selection outcomes across different racial and ethnic groups.
   - **Gender**: Evaluate outcomes based on gender identity.
   - **Age**: Assess selection rates for different age groups.
   - **Disability Status**: Consider outcomes for candidates with disabilities.

2. **Job Levels**:
   - **Entry-Level Positions**: Analyze bias in selection for entry-level roles.
   - **Mid-Level Positions**: Evaluate promotion and selection for mid-level roles.
   - **Executive Positions**: Assess bias in selection for senior leadership roles.

3. **Geographic Regions**:
   - **Regional Analysis**: Perform calculations based on geographic location to identify regional disparities in selection outcomes.

4. **Educational Background**:
   - **Degree Type**: Analyze selection rates based on the type of degree (e.g., bachelor’s, master’s).
   - **Institution Type**: Consider the impact of the institution attended (e.g., public vs. private).

5. **Experience Levels**:
   - **Years of Experience**: Evaluate how selection rates vary with different levels of experience.

§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of

(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit

Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Here are the key categories and the calculations typically performed for each:

### 1. **Data Quality Assessment**
   - **Missing Data Analysis**: Calculate the percentage of missing values for each feature.
   - **Outlier Detection**: Use statistical methods (e.g., Z-scores, IQR) to identify and quantify outliers in the dataset.
   - **Distribution Analysis**: Assess the distribution of features (mean, median, mode, variance) to identify skewness or kurtosis.

### 2. **Demographic Parity**
   - **Group Representation**: Calculate the proportion of different demographic groups in the dataset.
   - **Outcome Disparity**: Compare the positive outcome rates across demographic groups (e.g., success rates for different races or genders).
   - **Statistical Tests**: Use Chi-square tests or t-tests to determine if differences in outcomes are statistically significant.

### 3. **Equal Opportunity**
   - **True Positive Rate (TPR)**: Calculate TPR for each demographic group to assess fairness in positive outcomes.
   - **False Positive Rate (FPR)**: Calculate FPR for each demographic group to evaluate the risk of incorrect positive outcomes.
   - **Disparity Ratios**: Compute ratios of TPR and FPR between groups to identify disparities.

### 4. **Predictive Parity**
   - **Predictive Accuracy**: Calculate accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for each demographic group.
   - **Calibration**: Assess the calibration of predicted probabilities across groups (e.g., using Brier score or reliability diagrams).

### 5. **Treatment Equality**
   - **Treatment Rate**: Calculate the proportion of individuals from each demographic group receiving a particular treatment or outcome.
   - **Outcome Comparison**: Compare the average outcomes for treated vs. untreated individuals across demographic groups.

### 6. **Feature Importance and Sensitivity Analysis**
   - **Feature Contribution**: Use techniques like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) or LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to quantify the contribution of each feature to the model's predictions.
   - **Sensitivity Analysis**: Assess how changes in input features affect outcomes, particularly for sensitive attributes.

### 7. **Model Performance Metrics**
   - **ROC-AUC**: Calculate the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve for different demographic groups.
   - **Confusion Matrix**: Generate confusion matrices for each group to analyze true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

### 8. **Longitudinal Analysis (if applicable)**
   - **Temporal Bias**: Analyze how model performance and outcomes change over time for different demographic groups.
   - **Cohort Analysis**: Compare outcomes across different cohorts to identify any shifts in bias.

### 9. **Feedback Loop Analysis**
   - **Recidivism Rates**: In criminal justice applications, analyze recidivism rates across demographic groups to assess potential feedback loops.
   - **Impact Assessment**: Evaluate how the model's decisions impact different groups over time.

### 10. **Stakeholder Impact Assessment**
   - **Surveys and Interviews**: Collect qualitative data from affected stakeholders to assess perceived bias and impact.
   - **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Evaluate the economic and social costs associated with biased outcomes.

### Conclusion
Each of these calculations and analyses helps to identify, quantify, and mitigate bias in AEDTs. The specific methods and metrics may vary depending on the context and application of the AEDT, but the overarching goal is to ensure fairness, accountability, and transparency in automated decision-making processes.",False,"The agent's answer provides a comprehensive list of calculations for a bias audit of an AEDT, but it does not specifically mention the selection rate and impact ratio, which are key calculations according to the ground truth.",0.2692307692307692,0.8443636298179626,2.0,"The generated answer provides a comprehensive overview of various calculations for a bias audit but fails to specifically mention the selection rate and impact ratio, which are critical components of the user query."
What is the role of the AEDT in conducting bias audits and what are the requirements for using historical data in the audit?,"The AEDT (Applicant Employment Data Template) is used to conduct bias audits. It provides historical data that is used to assess bias in hiring practices. Employers and employment agencies can rely on a bias audit that uses the historical data of the AEDT, either from their own use or from other employers or agencies, if certain conditions are met. If insufficient historical data is available, test data can be used for a bias audit.","Document 13: 6

these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex', 'seed_document_id': 13, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","The **Algorithmic Equity and Data Transparency (AEDT)** framework plays a crucial role in conducting bias audits, particularly in the context of algorithmic decision-making systems. Here’s an overview of its role and the requirements for using historical data in audits:

### Role of AEDT in Conducting Bias Audits

1. **Framework Establishment**: AEDT provides a structured approach to assess and mitigate biases in algorithms. It sets guidelines for evaluating the fairness, accountability, and transparency of algorithmic systems.

2. **Bias Identification**: AEDT helps in identifying potential biases in algorithms by establishing metrics and methodologies for measuring fairness across different demographic groups.

3. **Standardization**: It promotes standard practices for conducting audits, ensuring consistency and reliability in the evaluation process.

4. **Stakeholder Engagement**: AEDT encourages collaboration among stakeholders, including developers, users, and affected communities, to gather diverse perspectives on bias and fairness.

5. **Reporting and Transparency**: The framework emphasizes the importance of transparent reporting of audit findings, allowing stakeholders to understand the implications of algorithmic decisions.

### Requirements for Using Historical Data in the Audit

1. **Data Relevance**: Historical data used in audits must be relevant to the algorithm's context and the specific decisions it makes. This ensures that the audit accurately reflects the algorithm's performance.

2. **Data Quality**: The data should be of high quality, meaning it should be accurate, complete, and representative of the population affected by the algorithm. Poor-quality data can lead to misleading audit results.

3. **Bias Assessment**: Historical data should be assessed for existing biases before being used in the audit. This includes examining how historical inequalities may influence the data and, consequently, the algorithm's outcomes.

4. **Demographic Representation**: The data should adequately represent different demographic groups to ensure that the audit can effectively evaluate fairness across these groups.

5. **Ethical Considerations**: The use of historical data must adhere to ethical standards, including considerations of privacy, consent, and the potential impact on marginalized communities.

6. **Documentation**: Clear documentation of the data sources, methodologies, and any limitations of the historical data used in the audit is essential for transparency and reproducibility.

By adhering to these principles and requirements, the AEDT framework can effectively guide organizations in conducting thorough and meaningful bias audits, ultimately leading to more equitable algorithmic systems.",False,"The agent's answer incorrectly identifies AEDT as the Algorithmic Equity and Data Transparency framework, while the ground truth specifies it as the Applicant Employment Data Template. Additionally, the agent's response does not address the specific conditions under which historical data can be used in bias audits, nor does it mention the use of test data when historical data is insufficient.",0.1612903225806451,0.8201340436935425,3.0,"The generated answer provides a detailed explanation of the AEDT's role in bias audits and the requirements for using historical data, but it incorrectly defines AEDT as the Algorithmic Equity and Data Transparency framework instead of the Applicant Employment Data Template, which is a significant factual error."
What is the definition of an automated employment decision tool and what are the requirements for its use in the city?,"An automated employment decision tool is any computational process, derived from machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence, that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation, that is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons. It does not include tools that do not automate, support, substantially assist, or replace discretionary decision-making processes and that do not materially impact natural persons.","Document 24: File #: Int 1894-2020, Version: A

### Requirements for Use in the City

While specific requirements can vary by jurisdiction, many cities have implemented regulations to ensure fairness and transparency in the use of AEDTs. Common requirements may include:

1. **Transparency**: Employers must disclose the use of AEDTs to candidates and employees, explaining how the tool works and what data it uses.

2. **Bias Audits**: Regular assessments may be required to evaluate the tool for potential biases, ensuring it does not disproportionately affect certain groups based on race, gender, or other protected characteristics.

3. **Data Privacy**: Compliance with data protection laws is essential, ensuring that personal information is handled securely and ethically.

4. **Human Oversight**: Employers may be required to maintain a level of human oversight in the decision-making process, ensuring that automated decisions can be reviewed and challenged.

5. **Record Keeping**: Employers might need to keep records of the decisions made using AEDTs, including the criteria used and the outcomes, to facilitate audits and reviews.

6. **Candidate Rights**: Candidates may have the right to request information about how the AEDT impacted their application and to appeal decisions made by the tool.

these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex', 'seed_document_id': 13, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","The **Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT)** plays a crucial role in bias audits by assessing the fairness and potential biases in algorithms used for hiring and employment decisions. The AEDT evaluates how these tools impact different demographic groups, ensuring that they do not disproportionately disadvantage any particular group based on race, gender, or other protected characteristics.

### Role of AEDT in Bias Audits:
1. **Assessment of Algorithms**: The AEDT analyzes the decision-making processes of automated tools to identify any biases in outcomes.
2. **Data Analysis**: It examines historical data and test data to evaluate how the tool performs across different demographic groups.
3. **Recommendations**: Based on its findings, the AEDT may provide recommendations for adjustments to reduce bias and improve fairness in employment decisions.

### Circumstances for Reliance on Bias Audit:
Employers or employment agencies can rely on a bias audit using test data under certain conditions:

1. **Compliance with Regulations**: The audit must comply with relevant laws and regulations regarding employment practices and anti-discrimination.
2. **Transparency**: The methodology and findings of the bias audit should be transparent and accessible to stakeholders.
3. **Robustness of Test Data**: The test data used in the audit should be representative of the population and relevant to the employment context.
4. **Regular Updates**: Employers should conduct regular audits to ensure ongoing compliance and to adapt to changes in the workforce or societal norms.
5. **Mitigation Strategies**: If biases are identified, employers should implement strategies to mitigate these biases before relying on the AEDT for decision-making.

1. **Transparency**: Employers must provide clear information about how the tool works and the criteria it uses.
2. **Fairness**: The tool should be designed to avoid bias and discrimination against any group.
3. **Validation**: Employers must ensure that the tool is validated for its intended use and that it accurately predicts job performance.
4. **Compliance**: The use of the tool must comply with relevant laws and regulations regarding employment practices.

"What are the specific calculations and requirements that must be performed during a bias audit of an AEDT for selection rates, impact ratios, and categories of sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectionality?","A bias audit of an AEDT must, at a minimum, calculate the selection rate for each category, calculate the impact ratio for each category, ensure that the calculations separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories, and indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT that are not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category.","Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies;

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex', 'seed_document_id': 5, 'topic': 'Metrics/Data', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","Conducting a bias audit of an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT) involves several specific calculations and requirements to assess selection rates, impact ratios, and categories of sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectionality. Here’s a breakdown of the key components:

### 1. **Data Collection**
   - **Demographic Data**: Collect data on candidates, including sex, race/ethnicity, and any other relevant demographic information.
   - **Selection Data**: Gather data on the outcomes of the AEDT, such as who was selected for interviews, hires, or promotions.

### 2. **Selection Rates**
   - **Calculation**: 
     \[
     \text{Selection Rate} = \frac{\text{Number of Selected Candidates}}{\text{Total Number of Candidates in Group}}
     \]
   - **Groups**: Calculate selection rates for each demographic group (e.g., male, female, different racial/ethnic groups).

### 3. **Impact Ratios**
   - **Calculation**: 
     \[
     \text{Impact Ratio} = \frac{\text{Selection Rate of Protected Group}}{\text{Selection Rate of Non-Protected Group}}
     \]
   - **Interpretation**: An impact ratio of less than 0.8 may indicate potential adverse impact against the protected group.

### 4. **Intersectionality Analysis**
   - **Group Combinations**: Analyze selection rates and impact ratios for combinations of demographic categories (e.g., Black women, Hispanic men).
   - **Calculation**: Similar to the above, calculate selection rates and impact ratios for these intersectional groups.

### 5. **Statistical Significance**
   - **Testing**: Use statistical tests (e.g., Chi-square tests) to determine if differences in selection rates are statistically significant.
   - **Confidence Intervals**: Calculate confidence intervals for selection rates to assess the precision of the estimates.

### 6. **Documentation and Reporting**
   - **Summary Tables**: Create tables summarizing selection rates, impact ratios, and any significant findings.
   - **Narrative Analysis**: Provide a narrative that explains the findings, including any potential biases identified and recommendations for mitigation.

### 7. **Compliance with Legal Standards**
   - **EEOC Guidelines**: Ensure that the audit complies with Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) guidelines and any relevant local laws regarding employment practices.

### 8. **Recommendations for Improvement**
   - Based on the findings, suggest changes to the AEDT or hiring practices to mitigate any identified biases.

### 9. **Continuous Monitoring**
   - Establish a plan for ongoing monitoring of the AEDT to ensure that biases do not re-emerge over time.

### Conclusion
A thorough bias audit of an AEDT requires careful data collection, precise calculations of selection rates and impact ratios, and a nuanced understanding of intersectionality. The goal is to identify and address any potential biases in the hiring process to promote fairness and equity.",False,"While the agent's answer provides a detailed overview of the bias audit process, it does not explicitly mention the requirement to indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT that are not included in the calculations due to unknown categories, which is a key aspect of the ground truth.",0.5862068965517241,0.7556291222572327,4.0,"The generated answer covers all components of the user query and provides detailed calculations and requirements, but it includes some extraneous information that, while correct, is not strictly necessary for the specific calculations and requirements asked for in the query."

New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection 
 
Notice of Adoption of Final Rule 
 
Pursuant to the authority vested in the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection by 
Sections 1043 and 2203(f) of the New York City Charter and Section 20-104(b) of the New York City 
Administrative Code, and in accordance with the requirements of Section 1043 of the New York City Charter, 
the Department amends Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York.  
 
An initial version of this rule was proposed and published on September 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on 
November 4, 2022, and comments regarding the rule were received. DCWP proposed a second version of this 
rule on December 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on January 23, 2023, and comments regarding the rule 
were received.  
 
Statement of Basis and Purpose 
 
The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP” or “Department”) is adding rules to implement 
new legislation regarding automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”). Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits 
employers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has 
been subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly 
available, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   
 
These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making” means: 
i. 
to rely solely on a simplified output (score, tag, classification, ranking, etc.), with no other 
factors considered; or 
ii. 
 to use a simplified output as one of a set of criteria where the simplified output is weighted 
more than any other criterion in the set; or   
iii. 
to use a simplified output to overrule conclusions derived from other factors including 
human decision-making.  
  
Bias Audit. “Bias audit” means “Bias audit” as defined by § 20-870 of the Code.  
 
Candidate for Employment. “Candidate for employment” means a person who has applied for a specific 
employment position by submitting the necessary information or items in the format required by the 
employer or employment agency.  
 
Category. “Category” means any component 1 category required to be reported by employers pursuant 
to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States Code as specified in part 1602.7 of 
title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, as designated on the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission Employer Information Report EEO-1. 
 
Code. “Code” means the Administrative Code of the City of New York. 
 
Distribution Date. “Distribution date” means the date the employer or employment agency began using 
a specific AEDT.

This process involves analyzing the algorithms and data used in the tools to ensure they do not unfairly disadvantage or discriminate against certain groups based on characteristics such as race, gender, age, or other protected attributes. The goal of a bias audit is to promote fairness, transparency, and accountability in automated hiring processes, ensuring that decisions made by these tools are equitable and just.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed explanation of a 'Bias Audit' in the context of automated employment decision tools, but it does not match the ground truth definition, which references a specific legal definition from the Code.",0.0,0.9582529664039612,5.0,"The generated answer accurately defines 'Bias Audit' in the context of automated employment decision tools, covering all relevant components and providing additional context without any errors."
What is the distinction between historical data and test data in the context of conducting a bias audit for an AEDT?,Test data refers to data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.,"Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers

may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex', 'seed_document_id': 18, 'topic': 'Definitions', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","In the context of conducting a bias audit for an Automated Decision-Making Tool (AEDT), the distinction between historical data and test data is crucial for understanding how the system performs and identifying potential biases.

### Historical Data
- **Definition**: Historical data refers to the data that has been collected over time and is used to train the AEDT. This data reflects past decisions, outcomes, and behaviors.
- **Purpose**: It is used to develop the model, helping it learn patterns and relationships that inform its decision-making processes.
- **Characteristics**: Historical data can contain biases that are inherent in past decisions, societal norms, or systemic inequalities. If the historical data is biased, the AEDT may perpetuate or even amplify these biases in its outputs.
- **Example**: If an AEDT is trained on historical hiring data that reflects gender or racial biases, it may learn to favor certain demographics over others.

### Test Data
- **Definition**: Test data is a separate dataset used to evaluate the performance of the AEDT after it has been trained. This data is not used during the training phase.
- **Purpose**: The primary goal of using test data is to assess how well the AEDT generalizes to new, unseen data and to identify any biases in its predictions or decisions.
- **Characteristics**: Test data should ideally be representative of the population the AEDT will serve, and it should be free from the biases present in the historical data. However, if the test data is also biased, it may not accurately reflect the AEDT's performance in real-world scenarios.
- **Example**: If the test data includes a balanced representation of different demographics, it can help identify whether the AEDT treats all groups fairly, even if the historical data was biased.

### Summary
- **Historical Data**: Used for training the AEDT; may contain biases from past decisions.
- **Test Data**: Used for evaluating the AEDT's performance; should ideally be unbiased to accurately assess the model's fairness and effectiveness.

In conducting a bias audit, it's essential to analyze both types of data to understand how biases may affect the AEDT's outcomes and to ensure that the model is fair and equitable in its decision-making processes.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed explanation of both historical data and test data, but it does not directly address the ground truth, which simply states that test data is not historical data. The agent's response is overly complex and does not align with the concise nature of the ground truth.",0.8571428571428571,0.9777508974075316,5.0,"The generated answer accurately distinguishes between historical data and test data in the context of a bias audit for an AEDT, covering all components of the query with correct and relevant information."
Under what condition can an independent auditor exclude a category from the required calculations for impact ratio?,An independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio.,"Document 16: (d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Here are some common conditions under which exclusion might occur:

1. **Materiality**: If the category in question is deemed immaterial to the overall financial position or performance of the organization, the auditor may choose to exclude it from the calculations.

2. **Irrelevance**: If the category does not align with the organization's objectives or the purpose of the impact ratio, it may be excluded. For example, if the category does not contribute to the assessment of the organization's impact or effectiveness, it may not be necessary for inclusion.

3. **Lack of Reliable Data**: If the data for a particular category is unreliable or cannot be accurately measured, the auditor may exclude it to ensure the integrity of the impact ratio calculations.

4. **Regulatory or Compliance Guidelines**: Certain regulations or guidelines may specify which categories must be included or excluded in the calculations. If a category falls outside these guidelines, it may be excluded.

5. **Consistency with Prior Periods**: If a category was excluded in prior periods and the exclusion is justified, the auditor may continue to exclude it for consistency in reporting.

6. **Specific Audit Objectives**: Depending on the specific objectives of the audit, certain categories may be excluded if they do not serve the purpose of the audit.

It's essential for the auditor to document the rationale for any exclusions to maintain transparency and ensure that stakeholders understand the basis for the calculations.",False,"The agent's answer provides general conditions for exclusion but does not mention the specific threshold of less than 2% of the data, which is a key detail in the ground truth answer.",0.217391304347826,0.9923300743103028,3.0,"The generated answer provides relevant information about conditions for exclusion but does not specifically mention the 2% threshold, which is a key detail from the reference answer."

§ 20-870 Definitions.
For the purposes of this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings:
   Automated employment decision tool. The term ""automated employment decision tool"" means any computational process, derived from machine
learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence, that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation,
that is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons. The term
""automated employment decision tool"" does not include a tool that does not automate, support, substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-
making processes and that does not materially impact natural persons, including, but not limited to, a junk email filter, firewall, antivirus software,
calculator, spreadsheet, database, data set, or other compilation of data.
   Bias audit. The term ""bias audit"" means an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor. Such bias audit shall include but not be limited to the
testing of an automated employment decision tool to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported
by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of

(L.L.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex', 'seed_document_id': 24, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","When employers or employment agencies use automated employment decision tools (AEDTs) to screen candidates or employees, they must comply with various legal requirements and notices to ensure fairness, transparency, and non-discrimination. Here are some key considerations:

### 1. **Compliance with Anti-Discrimination Laws**
   - **Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Laws**: Employers must ensure that the use of AEDTs does not result in discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, or genetic information.
   - **Adverse Impact Analysis**: Employers should conduct an analysis to determine if the AEDT disproportionately affects certain protected groups.

### 2. **Transparency and Disclosure**
   - **Notice to Candidates**: Employers should inform candidates that an AEDT is being used in the hiring process. This notice should include:
     - The nature of the tool and its purpose.
     - How the tool works and what data it uses.
   - **Right to Request Information**: Candidates may have the right to request information about how the AEDT works and the criteria it uses.

### 3. **Data Privacy and Security**
   - **Compliance with Data Protection Laws**: Employers must comply with applicable data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) regarding the collection, storage, and processing of personal data.
   - **Data Minimization**: Only relevant data should be collected and used in the AEDT.

### 4. **Fairness and Validity**
   - **Validation Studies**: Employers should conduct validation studies to ensure that the AEDT is predictive of job performance and does not unfairly disadvantage any group.
   - **Regular Audits**: Regular audits of the AEDT should be conducted to assess its effectiveness and fairness.

### 5. **Opportunity for Human Review**
   - **Human Oversight**: Candidates should have the opportunity for their applications to be reviewed by a human if they are adversely affected by the AEDT's decision.

### 6. **Record Keeping**
   - **Documentation**: Employers should maintain records of the AEDT's use, including the criteria used, the outcomes, and any analyses conducted to assess its impact.

### 7. **State and Local Regulations**
   - **Compliance with Local Laws**: Some states and localities have specific regulations regarding the use of AEDTs, including additional notice requirements or restrictions on their use.

### 8. **Training and Awareness**
   - **Training for HR Personnel**: Employers should train HR personnel on the use of AEDTs, including understanding the potential biases and limitations of these tools.

### Conclusion
Employers and employment agencies must navigate a complex landscape of legal and ethical considerations when using automated employment decision tools. Compliance with anti-discrimination laws, transparency, data privacy, and fairness are critical to ensuring that the use of these tools is responsible and equitable.",False,"The agent's answer provides detailed requirements and considerations for using automated employment decision tools, but it does not define what an automated employment decision tool is, which is the focus of the ground truth answer.",0.25,0.866960883140564,5.0,"The generated answer comprehensively addresses the user query by outlining the requirements and notices employers or employment agencies must comply with when using automated employment decision tools, aligning closely with the reference answer."

1. **Job Postings**: Include a clear statement in job advertisements that mentions the use of AEDTs in the hiring process.

2. **Application Materials**: Provide information about AEDTs in the application forms or instructions, ensuring candidates are aware before they apply.

3. **Candidate Communication**: Send emails or letters to candidates post-application, detailing the use of AEDTs and how they will be utilized in the selection process.

4. **Interviews**: Inform candidates during the interview process, either verbally or through informational handouts, about the use of AEDTs.

5. **Company Website**: Create a dedicated section on the company’s careers page that explains the use of AEDTs, including their purpose and how they impact the hiring process.

6. **Pre-Employment Assessments**: If assessments are part of the hiring process, provide candidates with information about the AEDT being used and its relevance.

7. **Candidate FAQs**: Develop a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section that addresses common queries about AEDTs, including their implications for candidates.

8. **Training for Recruiters**: Ensure that recruiters and hiring managers are trained to communicate about AEDTs effectively and transparently with candidates.

9. **Consent Forms**: Include a consent form that candidates must sign, acknowledging their understanding of the use of AEDTs in the hiring process.

10. **Follow-Up Communication**: After the hiring decision, provide feedback to candidates, including information about how AEDTs influenced the decision-making process.

By employing a combination of these methods, employers can ensure that candidates are well-informed about the use of AEDTs, promoting transparency and trust in the hiring process.",False,"The agent's answer provides various methods for notifying candidates about AEDTs but does not mention the specific requirement of providing notice at least 10 business days before use, which is a key detail in the ground truth.",0.0952380952380952,0.8639283776283264,3.0,"The generated answer provides several methods for notifying candidates about AEDTs, addressing multiple components of the query, but it lacks specific mention of the required 10 business days notice and includes some extraneous information."
What are the criteria and calculations required for conducting a bias audit on the published results of an AEDT?,The published results of a bias audit must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category required to be reported to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to determine an impact ratio.,"Document 9: 4 
 
iii. 
at any point during the bias audit, has a direct financial interest or a material indirect 
financial interest in an employer or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to 
use the  AEDT or in a vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT. 
 
Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.  
 
 
 
    _________selection rate for a category________  
Impact Ratio =        selection rate of the most selected category  
 
OR 
 
  
 
     ______scoring rate for a category__________  
Impact Ratio =        scoring rate of the highest scoring category 
 
 
Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;",[],"{'question_type': 'complex', 'seed_document_id': 9, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","Conducting a bias audit on the published results of an Automated Decision Tool (AEDT) involves several criteria and calculations to ensure that the tool operates fairly and without bias. Here’s a structured approach to performing such an audit:

### 1. **Define Objectives and Scope**
   - **Objective**: Determine what biases you are looking for (e.g., racial, gender, socioeconomic).
   - **Scope**: Identify the specific outcomes and decisions made by the AEDT that will be audited.

### 2. **Data Collection**
   - **Gather Data**: Collect the relevant datasets used by the AEDT, including input features and output decisions.
   - **Demographic Information**: Ensure that demographic data (e.g., age, race, gender) is included to analyze potential biases.

### 3. **Identify Key Metrics**
   - **Disparate Impact**: Calculate the proportion of different demographic groups receiving favorable outcomes.
   - **Equal Opportunity**: Assess whether different groups have equal chances of receiving positive outcomes.
   - **Predictive Parity**: Check if the predictive performance (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) is consistent across groups.

### 4. **Statistical Tests**
   - **Chi-Square Test**: Use this test to determine if there is a significant association between demographic groups and outcomes.
   - **T-tests or ANOVA**: Compare means of outcomes across different demographic groups to identify significant differences.
   - **Regression Analysis**: Conduct logistic regression to see if demographic variables significantly predict outcomes after controlling for other factors.

### 5. **Fairness Metrics**
   - **Statistical Parity**: Compare the rates of positive outcomes across groups.
   - **Calibration**: Check if predicted probabilities correspond to actual outcomes across groups.
   - **Treatment Equality**: Ensure that similar individuals receive similar outcomes regardless of group membership.

### 6. **Visualizations**
   - **Disparity Charts**: Create bar charts or histograms to visualize the distribution of outcomes across demographic groups.
   - **ROC Curves**: Plot Receiver Operating Characteristic curves for different groups to compare model performance.

### 7. **Sensitivity Analysis**
   - **Feature Importance**: Analyze which features are most influential in the decision-making process and assess if they correlate with sensitive attributes.
   - **Scenario Testing**: Test how changes in input features affect outcomes across different demographic groups.

### 8. **Documentation and Reporting**
   - **Findings**: Document any identified biases, their potential impact, and the statistical significance of your findings.
   - **Recommendations**: Provide actionable recommendations for mitigating identified biases, such as model retraining or feature adjustments.

### 9. **Stakeholder Engagement**
   - **Feedback Loop**: Engage with stakeholders (e.g., affected communities, policymakers) to discuss findings and gather input on potential solutions.

### 10. **Continuous Monitoring**
   - **Ongoing Audits**: Establish a framework for regular audits to ensure that the AEDT remains fair over time as data and societal norms evolve.

Conducting a bias audit on an AEDT is a multi-faceted process that requires careful planning, statistical analysis, and stakeholder engagement. By following these criteria and calculations, you can assess the fairness of the AEDT and work towards mitigating any identified biases.",False,"The agent's answer provides a comprehensive overview of conducting a bias audit but does not specifically mention calculating the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category or comparing these rates to determine an impact ratio, which is a key aspect of the ground truth.",0.1489361702127659,0.8974511623382568,3.0,The generated answer provides a comprehensive overview of conducting a bias audit but does not specifically mention the calculation of selection rates or impact ratios as required by the user query.

1. **Transparency**: Employers must inform candidates that an automated tool is being used in the hiring process. This includes providing details about how the tool works and what data it uses.

2. **Fairness and Non-Discrimination**: Employers must ensure that the automated tool does not discriminate against candidates based on protected characteristics (e.g., race, gender, age, disability). This often involves conducting a disparate impact analysis to assess whether the tool disproportionately affects certain groups.

3. **Validation and Testing**: Employers should validate the tool to ensure it accurately predicts job performance and is not biased. This may involve conducting tests and analyses to confirm that the tool is effective and fair.

4. **Data Privacy**: Employers must comply with data protection laws, ensuring that candidate data is collected, stored, and processed securely. This includes obtaining consent from candidates for data usage.

5. **Record Keeping**: Employers may be required to maintain records of the automated decision-making process, including the criteria used by the tool and the outcomes of its assessments.

6. **Right to Appeal**: Candidates should be informed of their right to appeal or contest decisions made by the automated tool. This may involve providing a mechanism for candidates to request a review of their application.

2. **Labor Relations Boards**: In some cases, labor relations boards or commissions may have the authority to adjudicate matters related to employment practices and penalties.

3. **Civil Courts**: Depending on the nature of the violation and the specific laws in question, civil courts may also have jurisdiction to hear cases related to civil penalties.

4. **Equal Employment Opportunity Commissions**: In the U.S., for example, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) may be involved if the automated tools are found to violate anti-discrimination laws.

5. **State or Local Human Rights Commissions**: Many states and localities have their own human rights commissions that handle complaints related to employment discrimination and may impose civil penalties.

Here’s how it typically works:

1. **Data Collection**: The AEDT gathers demographic information about applicants, such as age, gender, race, and ethnicity, alongside their qualifications and outcomes in the hiring process.

2. **Analysis of Outcomes**: The tool assesses how different demographic groups perform in the hiring process. This includes examining the rates at which applicants from various backgrounds are selected for interviews, offered jobs, or advanced in the hiring process.

3. **Identifying Disparities**: By comparing the selection rates and outcomes across different demographic groups, the AEDT can identify any significant disparities. For example, if one demographic group is consistently less likely to be hired despite having similar qualifications, this could indicate potential bias in the hiring process.

4. **Adjusting Algorithms**: If biases are detected, organizations can use the insights from the AEDT to adjust their hiring algorithms or processes to promote fairness and equity. This might involve re-evaluating the criteria used for selection or implementing additional training for hiring managers.

5. **Reporting and Transparency**: The findings from the bias audit can be documented and reported to stakeholders, ensuring transparency in the hiring process and demonstrating a commitment to diversity and inclusion.

Overall, the AEDT serves as a critical tool in identifying and mitigating bias in hiring practices, helping organizations to create a more equitable recruitment process.",False,"The agent incorrectly defines AEDT as the Automated Employment Decision Tool instead of the Applicant Employment Data Template, and it does not accurately reflect the specific use of AEDT in providing historical data for bias audits.",0.7083333333333334,0.8532156348228455,4.0,"The generated answer provides a comprehensive explanation of how the AEDT is used in bias audits, covering all relevant components accurately, but it slightly misidentifies AEDT as ""Automated Employment Decision Tool"" instead of ""Applicant Employment Data Template."""
What is the process for calculating the impact ratio in a bias audit of an AEDT?,A bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category that is required to be reported to the EEOC and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to determine an impact ratio. The calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures.,"Document 9: 4 
 
iii. 
at any point during the bias audit, has a direct financial interest or a material indirect 
financial interest in an employer or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to 
use the  AEDT or in a vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT. 
 
Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.  
 
 
 
    _________selection rate for a category________  
Impact Ratio =        selection rate of the most selected category  
 
OR 
 
  
 
     ______scoring rate for a category__________  
Impact Ratio =        scoring rate of the highest scoring category 
 
 
Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  


The impact ratio is typically used to assess the fairness and equity of the decisions made by the AEDT, particularly in relation to different demographic groups. Here’s a general process for calculating the impact ratio:

### 1. **Define the Scope and Objectives**
   - Determine the specific decisions made by the AEDT that will be audited.
   - Identify the demographic groups to be analyzed (e.g., race, gender, age).

### 2. **Collect Data**
   - Gather data on the outcomes of the AEDT's decisions, including:
     - Total number of decisions made.
     - Number of favorable outcomes for each demographic group.
     - Number of unfavorable outcomes for each demographic group.
   - Ensure that the data is representative and covers a sufficient time period.

### 3. **Calculate Base Rates**
   - For each demographic group, calculate the base rate of favorable outcomes:
     \[
     \text{Base Rate} = \frac{\text{Number of Favorable Outcomes}}{\text{Total Decisions for the Group}}
     \]

### 4. **Calculate Overall Base Rate**
   - Calculate the overall base rate across all groups:
     \[
     \text{Overall Base Rate} = \frac{\text{Total Number of Favorable Outcomes Across All Groups}}{\text{Total Decisions Across All Groups}}
     \]

### 5. **Calculate Impact Ratios**
   - For each demographic group, calculate the impact ratio:
     \[
     \text{Impact Ratio} = \frac{\text{Base Rate of the Group}}{\text{Overall Base Rate}}
     \]
   - An impact ratio of 1 indicates parity with the overall population, while values greater than 1 indicate over-representation and values less than 1 indicate under-representation.

### 6. **Analyze Results**
   - Compare the impact ratios across different demographic groups to identify any disparities.
   - Assess whether certain groups are disproportionately affected by the AEDT's decisions.

### 7. **Document Findings**
   - Prepare a report summarizing the methodology, findings, and any recommendations for mitigating bias in the AEDT.

### 8. **Implement Changes (if necessary)**
   - Based on the findings, consider adjustments to the AEDT to improve fairness and reduce bias.

### 9. **Continuous Monitoring**
   - Establish a process for ongoing monitoring and auditing of the AEDT to ensure that bias is continually assessed and addressed.

### Conclusion
The impact ratio is a crucial metric in understanding the fairness of an AEDT. By following these steps, organizations can systematically evaluate and address potential biases in their automated decision-making processes.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed process for calculating the impact ratio but does not align with the specific requirements outlined in the ground truth, which emphasizes the selection rates for race/ethnicity and sex categories as per EEOC guidelines.",0.8076923076923077,0.9637800455093384,4.0,"The generated answer provides a comprehensive and mostly accurate process for calculating the impact ratio in a bias audit of an AEDT, but it lacks specific reference to the EEOC guidelines and the comparison to the most selected category, which are key components of the reference answer."

"In the context of the provided example, what are the two possible meanings of 'Impact Ratio'?","The 'Impact Ratio' refers to either the selection rate for a category divided by the selection rate of the most selected category, or the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the highest scoring category.","Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the

Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on

§ 20-870 Definitions.
For the purposes of this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings:
   Automated employment decision tool. The term ""automated employment decision tool"" means any computational process, derived from machine
learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence, that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation,
that is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons. The term
""automated employment decision tool"" does not include a tool that does not automate, support, substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-
making processes and that does not materially impact natural persons, including, but not limited to, a junk email filter, firewall, antivirus software,
calculator, spreadsheet, database, data set, or other compilation of data.
   Bias audit. The term ""bias audit"" means an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor. Such bias audit shall include but not be limited to the
testing of an automated employment decision tool to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported
by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of
federal regulations.

This can include:

1. **Hiring Decisions**: Determining whether to offer a candidate a job based on their qualifications, experience, and fit for the role.

2. **Promotion Decisions**: Evaluating whether an existing employee should be promoted based on performance metrics and other criteria.

3. **Retention Decisions**: Assessing whether to retain an employee or initiate termination based on performance evaluations or predictive analytics.

4. **Compensation Decisions**: Deciding on salary increases, bonuses, or other financial incentives based on performance data.

5. **Training and Development**: Identifying candidates for training programs or professional development opportunities based on skill assessments.

6. **Disciplinary Actions**: Making decisions related to employee conduct and potential disciplinary measures based on behavior tracking.

These decisions are often influenced by algorithms that analyze various data points, such as resumes, performance reviews, and other metrics, to streamline the hiring process and improve efficiency. However, the use of automated tools raises concerns about bias, transparency, and fairness, necessitating careful consideration of how these tools are designed and implemented.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed explanation of various types of employment decisions but does not specifically define 'employment decision' as it relates to screening candidates or employees, as stated in the ground truth.",0.5789473684210527,0.9209863543510436,3.0,"The generated answer provides a broad definition of 'employment decision' and covers multiple components related to employment screening, but it diverges from the specific context of the user query by including additional types of decisions that are not directly related to screening candidates or employees."
What criteria must be met in order to exclude a category from the required calculations for the impact ratio in a bias audit of an AEDT?,"A bias audit of an AEDT must, at a minimum, calculate the selection rate for each category, calculate the impact ratio for each category, ensure that the calculations separately calculate the impact on sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories, and indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT that are not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category.","Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.",[],"{'question_type': 'distracting element', 'seed_document_id': 5, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': '(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and \n(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of \nthe data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio.

While specific requirements may vary depending on the regulatory framework or guidelines being followed, common criteria include:

1. **Insufficient Data**: If there is not enough data available for a particular category to conduct a meaningful analysis, it may be excluded. This could be due to a lack of representation or sample size.

2. **Irrelevance to the Decision-Making Process**: If the category does not significantly influence the outcomes or decisions made by the AEDT, it may be deemed irrelevant and excluded from the calculations.

3. **Non-Applicability**: Certain categories may not apply to the specific context or use case of the AEDT. For example, if a category is not relevant to the population being served, it may be excluded.

4. **Legal or Ethical Considerations**: Categories that are protected under anti-discrimination laws or ethical guidelines may be excluded to avoid potential bias or discrimination in the audit process.

5. **Technical Limitations**: If the methodology or tools used for the audit cannot adequately assess a particular category due to technical constraints, it may be excluded.

6. **Stakeholder Agreement**: In some cases, stakeholders involved in the audit process may agree to exclude certain categories based on consensus or specific criteria established during the audit planning phase.

7. **Historical Context**: If a category has historically shown no significant impact on the outcomes being measured, it may be excluded based on past analyses.

8. **Consistency with Audit Objectives**: The exclusion must align with the overall objectives of the bias audit, ensuring that the focus remains on the most relevant and impactful categories.

It's essential to document the rationale for excluding any category to maintain transparency and accountability in the audit process.",False,"The agent's answer provides criteria for excluding categories from calculations in a bias audit, but it does not address the specific requirements for calculating the impact ratio as outlined in the ground truth.

Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or \nemployment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available \nto conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the \nbias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was \ngenerated and obtained.  \n \nExample 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias \naudit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit \nconducted using test data.', 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","Conducting a bias audit of an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT) using historical data involves several specific requirements. Here’s a structured approach to ensure a comprehensive audit:

### 1. **Define Objectives and Scope**
   - **Purpose of the Audit**: Clearly outline what you aim to achieve (e.g., identifying bias against specific demographic groups).
   - **Scope**: Determine which aspects of the AEDT will be audited (e.g., hiring decisions, promotions).

### 2. **Data Collection**
   - **Historical Data**: Gather relevant historical data used by the AEDT, including:
     - Candidate demographics (age, gender, race, etc.)
     - Application outcomes (hired, rejected, etc.)
     - Features used in the decision-making process.
   - **Data Quality**: Ensure the data is clean, complete, and representative of the population.

### 3. **Legal and Ethical Considerations**
   - **Compliance**: Ensure adherence to relevant laws and regulations (e.g., EEOC guidelines, GDPR).
   - **Informed Consent**: If applicable, ensure that data collection complies with privacy standards and that candidates are informed about data usage.

### 4. **Statistical Analysis**
   - **Bias Metrics**: Define metrics to measure bias, such as:
     - Disparate impact analysis (e.g., 80% rule).
     - Predictive parity (comparing false positive/negative rates across groups).
   - **Statistical Tests**: Use appropriate statistical tests to assess bias (e.g., Chi-square tests, logistic regression).

### 5. **Model Evaluation**
   - **Performance Metrics**: Evaluate the AEDT’s performance across different demographic groups using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
   - **Fairness Metrics**: Assess fairness using metrics such as:
     - Equal opportunity
     - Calibration
     - Treatment equality

### 6. **Documentation and Reporting**
   - **Audit Report**: Prepare a comprehensive report detailing:
     - Methodology
     - Findings
     - Recommendations for mitigating bias.
   - **Transparency**: Ensure the audit process and results are transparent and accessible to stakeholders.

### 7. **Stakeholder Engagement**
   - **Involve Stakeholders**: Engage with relevant stakeholders (e.g., HR, legal, diversity officers) throughout the audit process.
   - **Feedback Mechanism**: Establish a process for stakeholders to provide input on findings and recommendations.

### 8. **Remediation Strategies**
   - **Action Plan**: Develop a plan to address identified biases, which may include:
     - Adjusting the AEDT algorithms.
     - Implementing additional training for decision-makers.
     - Regularly updating the audit process.

### 9. **Continuous Monitoring**
   - **Ongoing Audits**: Establish a schedule for regular bias audits to ensure ongoing compliance and fairness.
   - **Feedback Loop**: Create mechanisms for continuous feedback and improvement based on audit findings.

### 10. **Training and Awareness**
   - **Educate Stakeholders**: Provide training for stakeholders on bias, fairness, and the importance of audits in the context of AEDTs.

What calculations are required for a bias audit of an AEDT according to the new rules?,"A bias audit of an AEDT must, at a minimum, calculate the selection rate for each category, calculate the impact ratio for each category, separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories, and indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT that are not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category.","Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;

comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies;

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded

While the specific requirements can vary based on jurisdiction and the particular rules in place, here are some common calculations and methodologies typically involved in a bias audit:

1. **Disparate Impact Analysis**:
   - **Proportionality Ratios**: Calculate the proportion of different demographic groups that are affected by the AEDT's decisions. This can involve comparing the rates of favorable outcomes across groups.
   - **Impact Ratios**: Determine the ratio of outcomes for different groups (e.g., the ratio of positive outcomes for one demographic group compared to another).

2. **Statistical Parity**:
   - **Outcome Distribution**: Analyze the distribution of outcomes across different demographic groups to check for statistical parity. This involves calculating the percentage of each group receiving a positive outcome.

3. **Equal Opportunity Metrics**:
   - **True Positive Rate (TPR)**: Calculate the TPR for different groups to ensure that the AEDT is equally likely to correctly identify positive cases across demographics.
   - **False Positive Rate (FPR)**: Similarly, calculate the FPR for different groups to ensure that the AEDT does not disproportionately misclassify individuals from one group as positive.

4. **Calibration**:
   - **Calibration Curves**: Assess whether the predicted probabilities of outcomes are consistent across different demographic groups. This involves plotting predicted probabilities against actual outcomes.

5. **Predictive Parity**:
   - **Positive Predictive Value (PPV)**: Calculate the PPV for different groups to ensure that the proportion of true positives among predicted positives is similar across groups.

6. **Group Fairness Metrics**:
   - **Demographic Parity**: Check if the decision rates are similar across groups.
   - **Equalized Odds**: Ensure that both TPR and FPR are similar across groups.

7. **Sensitivity Analysis**:
   - Conduct sensitivity analyses to understand how changes in input data or model parameters affect outcomes across different demographic groups.

8. **Feature Importance Analysis**:
   - Analyze which features are most influential in the AEDT's decision-making process and assess whether these features introduce bias.

9. **Model Performance Metrics**:
   - Evaluate overall model performance (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) and compare these metrics across demographic groups.

10. **Documentation and Reporting**:
    - Document all findings, methodologies, and calculations clearly to ensure transparency and facilitate further review.

These calculations and analyses help identify potential biases in the AEDT and ensure that it operates fairly across different demographic groups.

Here are some key points:

1. **Legal Compliance**: Many jurisdictions require employers to report on various demographic categories (such as race, gender, age, disability status, etc.). A bias audit helps ensure that automated tools comply with anti-discrimination laws and regulations, reducing the risk of legal repercussions.

2. **Fairness and Equity**: Automated tools can inadvertently perpetuate or exacerbate existing biases in hiring practices. A bias audit helps identify and mitigate these biases, ensuring that all candidates are evaluated fairly, regardless of their demographic background.

3. **Diversity and Inclusion**: Organizations increasingly recognize the importance of diverse workforces. A bias audit can help ensure that automated tools support diversity initiatives rather than hinder them, promoting a more inclusive workplace.

4. **Reputation Management**: Companies that are perceived as fair and equitable in their hiring practices are more likely to attract top talent. Conducting a bias audit demonstrates a commitment to fairness and can enhance an organization's reputation.

5. **Improved Decision-Making**: By identifying biases in automated tools, organizations can refine their algorithms and decision-making processes, leading to better hiring outcomes and improved organizational performance.

6. **Stakeholder Trust**: Transparency in hiring practices fosters trust among employees, candidates, and the public. A bias audit can help build this trust by demonstrating that the organization is actively working to eliminate bias.

7. **Data-Driven Insights**: Bias audits can provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of hiring tools and processes, allowing organizations to make informed decisions about their recruitment strategies.

8. **Ethical Responsibility**: Beyond legal obligations, organizations have an ethical responsibility to ensure that their hiring practices are just and equitable. A bias audit is a step toward fulfilling this responsibility.

In summary, conducting a bias audit for automated employment decision tools is essential for ensuring fairness, compliance, and ethical hiring practices, ultimately leading to a more diverse and inclusive workplace.",False,The agent's answer provides a detailed explanation of the importance of conducting a bias audit but does not directly address the specific purpose of assessing the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported by employers.,0.3214285714285714,0.9063265323638916,4.0,"The generated answer addresses the importance of conducting a bias audit for automated employment decision tools comprehensively and accurately, covering multiple relevant aspects, but it does not explicitly mention the ""disparate impact"" on persons of any component 1 category as highlighted in the reference answer."
What are the requirements for conducting a bias audit of an AEDT used to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job posting?,"The requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT include calculating the selection rate for each category, calculating the impact ratio for each category, separately calculating the impact of the AEDT on sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race, performing the calculations for each group if the AEDT classifies candidates into specified groups, and indicating the number of individuals not included in the calculations due to falling within an unknown category.","Document 14: Data 
on those individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
(c) Where an AEDT scores candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion, a bias 
audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the median score for the full sample of applicants;  
(2) Calculate the scoring rate for individuals in each category;

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

1. **Use of AI or Algorithms**: If the tool employs artificial intelligence or algorithmic decision-making processes to evaluate candidates, it may be subject to bias audits.

2. **Impact on Employment Decisions**: The tool must significantly influence hiring, promotion, or other employment-related decisions. This includes tools that screen resumes, assess candidates, or make recommendations.

3. **Protected Characteristics**: If the tool's decisions could disproportionately affect individuals based on protected characteristics (e.g., race, gender, age, disability), a bias audit is often warranted.

4. **Scale of Use**: Tools used at scale, affecting a large number of candidates or employees, are more likely to require audits due to the broader impact of potential biases.

5. **Regulatory Requirements**: Certain jurisdictions have specific laws or guidelines mandating bias audits for automated decision-making tools, particularly in employment contexts.

6. **Transparency and Explainability**: If the tool lacks transparency or the ability to explain its decision-making process, it may necessitate a bias audit to ensure fairness.

7. **Historical Data**: If the tool is trained on historical data that may contain biases, it may require an audit to assess and mitigate those biases.

8. **Stakeholder Concerns**: If there are concerns raised by stakeholders (e.g., employees, advocacy groups) regarding fairness or discrimination, this may trigger the need for an audit.

9. **Performance Metrics**: If the tool's performance metrics indicate potential disparities in outcomes among different demographic groups, a bias audit may be necessary.

§ 20-871 Requirements for automated employment decision tools.
   a.   In the city, it shall be unlawful for an employer or an employment agency to use an automated employment decision tool to screen a candidate or
employee for an employment decision unless:
      1.   Such tool has been the subject of a bias audit conducted no more than one year prior to the use of such tool; and

1. **Fairness and Equity**: Automated tools can inadvertently perpetuate or amplify existing biases in hiring practices. A bias audit helps identify and mitigate these biases, ensuring that all candidates are evaluated fairly, regardless of their background.

2. **Legal Compliance**: Many jurisdictions have laws and regulations that require employers to ensure non-discriminatory practices in hiring. A bias audit can help organizations comply with these legal standards and avoid potential lawsuits or penalties.

3. **Transparency**: Automated decision-making processes can often be opaque. A bias audit promotes transparency by examining how decisions are made and ensuring that the algorithms used are understandable and justifiable.

4. **Improved Decision-Making**: By identifying biases, organizations can refine their algorithms and improve the overall quality of their hiring decisions. This can lead to better talent acquisition and a more diverse workforce.

5. **Reputation Management**: Companies that are perceived as fair and equitable in their hiring practices are more likely to attract top talent and maintain a positive public image. A bias audit can help safeguard an organization’s reputation.

6. **Stakeholder Trust**: Employees, candidates, and the public are increasingly concerned about fairness in hiring. Conducting a bias audit can build trust among stakeholders by demonstrating a commitment to ethical practices.

7. **Continuous Improvement**: A bias audit is not a one-time event but part of an ongoing process. Regular audits can help organizations adapt to changing societal norms and expectations regarding fairness and equity in employment.

In summary, a bias audit is essential to ensure that automated employment decision tools operate fairly, comply with legal standards, and contribute positively to an organization’s culture and reputation.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed explanation of the reasons for a bias audit but does not directly address the specific focus of the ground truth, which emphasizes assessing the tool's disparate impact on specific categories required to be reported by employers.",0.0967741935483871,0.9724923968315125,4.0,"The generated answer addresses the necessity of a bias audit for automated employment decision tools comprehensively and accurately, covering multiple relevant aspects, though it does not explicitly mention the assessment of disparate impact as highlighted in the reference answer."
What information should be included in the published results of the bias audit for the AEDT?,"The requirements for the published results of the bias audit include calculating the impact ratio for each category, separately calculating the impact of the AEDT on sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race. The results must also indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT that are not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category.","Document 9: 4 
 
iii. 
at any point during the bias audit, has a direct financial interest or a material indirect 
financial interest in an employer or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to 
use the  AEDT or in a vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT. 
 
Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.  
 
 
 
    _________selection rate for a category________

     ______scoring rate for a category__________  
Impact Ratio =        scoring rate of the highest scoring category 
 
 
Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will:

 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus;

This approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of how different demographic groups are affected by the AEDT's decisions. 

Calculating impact ratios separately helps identify any disparities in outcomes among various groups, which is crucial for assessing fairness and compliance with anti-discrimination laws. It also aids in pinpointing specific areas where the AEDT may be biased, enabling organizations to take targeted corrective actions.

(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category.

However, generally, a bias audit may involve the following calculations and analyses:

1. **Disparity Analysis**: 
   - Calculate the disparity in outcomes across different demographic groups (e.g., race, gender, age). This may involve comparing the rates of favorable outcomes for different groups.

2. **False Positive/Negative Rates**:
   - Determine the false positive and false negative rates for different demographic groups. This helps assess whether certain groups are disproportionately affected by incorrect decisions.

3. **Predictive Parity**:
   - Analyze whether the predictive performance (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) of the AEDT is consistent across demographic groups.

4. **Calibration**:
   - Check if the predicted probabilities of outcomes are calibrated across groups. This involves comparing the predicted probabilities to the actual outcomes for each group.

5. **Impact Assessment**:
   - Calculate the potential impact of the AEDT on different groups, which may involve estimating the number of individuals affected by biased outcomes.

6. **Statistical Tests**:
   - Perform statistical tests (e.g., Chi-square tests, t-tests) to determine if observed differences in outcomes across groups are statistically significant.

7. **Sensitivity Analysis**:
   - Conduct sensitivity analyses to see how changes in input data or model parameters affect outcomes across different demographic groups.

8. **Feature Importance Analysis**:
   - Analyze which features (inputs) are most influential in the decision-making process and whether these features disproportionately affect certain groups.

9. **Audit Trail Review**:
   - Review the audit trail of decisions made by the AEDT to identify patterns of bias or discrimination.

10. **Documentation and Reporting**:
    - Document all findings, methodologies, and calculations clearly to ensure transparency and accountability.

Document 0: Subchapter 25: Automated Employment Decision Tools
§ 20-870 Definitions.
For the purposes of this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings:
   Automated employment decision tool. The term ""automated employment decision tool"" means any computational process, derived from machine
learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence, that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation,
that is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons. The term
""automated employment decision tool"" does not include a tool that does not automate, support, substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-
making processes and that does not materially impact natural persons, including, but not limited to, a junk email filter, firewall, antivirus software,
calculator, spreadsheet, database, data set, or other compilation of data.
   Bias audit. The term ""bias audit"" means an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor. Such bias audit shall include but not be limited to the
testing of an automated employment decision tool to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported
by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of
federal regulations.
   Employment decision. The term ""employment decision"" means to screen candidates for employment or employees for promotion within the city.

Here are the key criteria and requirements:

1. **Bias Audit**: Employers must conduct a bias audit of the AEDT at least once every year. This audit should assess the tool's impact on different demographic groups to ensure it does not disproportionately disadvantage any group based on protected characteristics.

2. **Disclosure**: Employers are required to notify candidates when an AEDT is used in the hiring process. This includes informing candidates about the use of the tool and providing information about the tool's purpose.

3. **Data Transparency**: Employers must provide candidates with information about the AEDT, including the criteria used by the tool and the data it relies on.

4. **Candidate Rights**: Candidates have the right to request information about the AEDT, including the results of the bias audit and the specific factors that the tool considers in its decision-making process.

5. **Compliance with Anti-Discrimination Laws**: The use of AEDTs must comply with existing anti-discrimination laws, ensuring that the tools do not lead to discriminatory practices in hiring.

6. **Record Keeping**: Employers are required to maintain records related to the use of AEDTs, including the results of audits and any communications with candidates regarding the tool.

These requirements aim to promote transparency and fairness in the hiring process, ensuring that automated tools do not perpetuate bias or discrimination. Employers using AEDTs in New York City should ensure they are compliant with these regulations to avoid potential legal issues.",False,"The agent's answer provides specific requirements for automated employment decision tools in New York City, while the ground truth defines what constitutes an automated employment decision tool.

"I'm considering using an AEDT for the first time. Can I rely on a bias audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or can I conduct a bias audit using test data? What is the definition of 'test data' in the context of a bias audit?",'Test data' refers to data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.,"Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

### Relying on Historical Data vs. Test Data

1. **Historical Data**: 
   - This refers to data collected from past employment decisions made by other employers or employment agencies. While this data can provide insights into potential biases, it may not accurately reflect the specific context or demographics of your organization. Relying solely on historical data can lead to misleading conclusions if the data does not align with your current workforce or hiring practices.

2. **Test Data**: 
   - In the context of a bias audit, ""test data"" typically refers to a controlled set of data that you create or simulate to evaluate the performance of the AEDT. This data should be representative of the types of candidates you expect to evaluate and can include various demographic attributes. The goal is to assess how the AEDT performs across different groups and identify any potential biases in its decision-making process.

### Conducting a Bias Audit

- **Using Test Data**: 
  - Conducting a bias audit using test data allows you to simulate various scenarios and analyze how the AEDT responds. This can help you identify any disparities in outcomes based on demographic factors (e.g., race, gender, age) and make necessary adjustments to the tool or your hiring practices.

- **Combining Approaches**: 
  - Ideally, a comprehensive bias audit would combine both historical data and test data. Historical data can provide context and highlight trends, while test data allows for a more controlled evaluation of the AEDT's performance.

### Conclusion

In summary, while you can use historical data for insights, conducting a bias audit with test data is crucial for a more accurate assessment of the AEDT's fairness and effectiveness. Test data should be carefully designed to reflect the diversity of candidates you expect to encounter in your hiring process. This approach will help ensure that the AEDT operates without bias and aligns with your organization's values and legal requirements.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed explanation of test data in the context of a bias audit, but it does not directly match the ground truth definition, which is simply that 'test data' refers to data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.",1.0,0.0,4.0,"The generated answer correctly defines 'test data' in the context of a bias audit and addresses the user's query about using historical data versus test data, but it includes some extraneous information that, while relevant, is not strictly necessary for the definition."

New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection 
 
Notice of Adoption of Final Rule 
 
Pursuant to the authority vested in the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection by 
Sections 1043 and 2203(f) of the New York City Charter and Section 20-104(b) of the New York City 
Administrative Code, and in accordance with the requirements of Section 1043 of the New York City Charter, 
the Department amends Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York.  
 
An initial version of this rule was proposed and published on September 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on 
November 4, 2022, and comments regarding the rule were received. DCWP proposed a second version of this 
rule on December 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on January 23, 2023, and comments regarding the rule 
were received.  
 
Statement of Basis and Purpose 
 
The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP” or “Department”) is adding rules to implement 
new legislation regarding automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”). Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits 
employers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has 
been subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly 
available, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   
 
These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

Section 1.  Chapter 5 of Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York is amended to add Subchapter T to read 
as follows: 
Subchapter T: Automated Employment Decision Tools 
§ 5-300. Definitions. 
As used in this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings: 
 
Automated Employment Decision Tool. “Automated employment decision tool” or “AEDT” means 
“Automated employment decision tool” as defined by § 20-870 of the Code where the phrase “to 
substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making” means: 
i. 
to rely solely on a simplified output (score, tag, classification, ranking, etc.), with no other

as follows: 
Subchapter T: Automated Employment Decision Tools 
§ 5-300. Definitions. 
As used in this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings: 
 
Automated Employment Decision Tool. “Automated employment decision tool” or “AEDT” means 
“Automated employment decision tool” as defined by § 20-870 of the Code where the phrase “to 
substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making” means: 
i. 
to rely solely on a simplified output (score, tag, classification, ranking, etc.), with no other 
factors considered; or 
ii. 
 to use a simplified output as one of a set of criteria where the simplified output is weighted

Bias Audit. “Bias audit” means “Bias audit” as defined by § 20-870 of the Code.  
 
Candidate for Employment. “Candidate for employment” means a person who has applied for a specific 
employment position by submitting the necessary information or items in the format required by the 
employer or employment agency.  
 
Category. “Category” means any component 1 category required to be reported by employers pursuant 
to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States Code as specified in part 1602.7 of 
title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, as designated on the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission Employer Information Report EEO-1. 
 
Code. “Code” means the Administrative Code of the City of New York. 
 
Distribution Date. “Distribution date” means the date the employer or employment agency began using 
a specific AEDT.  
 
Employment Decision. “Employment decision” means “Employment decision” as defined by § 20-870

Under Local Law 144 in New York City, an ""automated employment decision tool"" (AEDT) is defined as any computational process, including algorithms and statistical techniques, that is used to assist in making employment decisions. This can include tools that evaluate candidates for hiring, promotions, or other employment-related decisions.

The law emphasizes that these tools must be used in a way that is transparent and fair, requiring employers to conduct bias audits and provide candidates with information about the use of such tools. The goal is to ensure that automated systems do not perpetuate discrimination or bias in the hiring process.

If you need more specific details or implications of this law, feel free to ask!",False,"The agent's definition lacks specific details about the nature of the computational processes (e.g., machine learning, statistical modeling) and the emphasis on simplified outputs like scores or classifications, which are key components of the ground truth definition.",0.5833333333333334,0.9836739897727966,4.0,"The generated answer correctly defines an automated employment decision tool and addresses its use in employment decisions, but it lacks some specific details from the reference answer regarding the nature of the computational processes involved."
Can you explain the meaning of test data in the context of a bias audit according to Local Law 144 and other policy documents?,Test data refers to data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.,"Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

In the context of a bias audit, particularly under Local Law 144 in New York City, ""test data"" refers to the datasets used to evaluate the fairness and bias of automated decision-making systems, especially those that impact hiring, promotions, and other employment-related decisions.

### Key Aspects of Test Data in Bias Audits:

1. **Purpose**: Test data is utilized to assess whether an algorithm or automated system produces biased outcomes based on protected characteristics such as race, gender, age, etc. The goal is to identify and mitigate any discriminatory effects that may arise from the use of these systems.

2. **Composition**: The test data should be representative of the population that the system will affect. This means it should include diverse demographic groups to ensure that the audit can accurately reflect how different segments of the population are treated by the algorithm.

3. **Evaluation Metrics**: The test data is analyzed using various metrics to determine fairness. This can include statistical measures like disparate impact, equal opportunity, and other fairness criteria that help identify biases in the decision-making process.

4. **Transparency and Accountability**: Local Law 144 emphasizes the need for transparency in the use of automated systems. The use of test data in bias audits is part of this transparency, as it allows stakeholders to understand how decisions are made and to hold organizations accountable for any biases that are uncovered.

5. **Regulatory Compliance**: Organizations subject to Local Law 144 are required to conduct bias audits using test data to ensure compliance with the law. This involves documenting the findings and making necessary adjustments to the algorithms to reduce bias.

6. **Continuous Improvement**: The use of test data is not a one-time process. Organizations are encouraged to continuously monitor and update their algorithms and test data to adapt to changing demographics and societal norms, ensuring ongoing fairness in automated decision-making.

### Conclusion

In summary, test data in the context of a bias audit under Local Law 144 serves as a critical tool for evaluating the fairness of automated systems. It helps organizations identify and mitigate biases, ensuring that their decision-making processes are equitable and compliant with legal standards.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed explanation of test data in the context of a bias audit but does not align with the ground truth, which specifically states that test data is data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.",0.3793103448275862,0.938574194908142,5.0,"The generated answer thoroughly explains the meaning of test data in the context of a bias audit according to Local Law 144, covering all relevant aspects accurately and comprehensively."

What is the threshold for excluding a category, such as sex or race/ethnicity, from the required calculations for impact ratio?",An independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio.,"Document 16: (d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of

According to this guideline, if the selection rate for a protected group (e.g., based on sex or race/ethnicity) is less than 80% of the selection rate for the group with the highest selection rate, it may indicate potential adverse impact. If the selection rate for a particular category is significantly lower than this threshold, it may warrant further investigation and could lead to the exclusion of that category from the calculations.

In practice, if the impact ratio for a specific category falls below this 80% threshold, it may be necessary to consider that category as having a potential adverse impact, and you should conduct a more thorough analysis to understand the implications before proceeding with the AEDT.

Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'situational', 'seed_document_id': 18, 'topic': 'Definitions', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': '{""description"": ""A legal chatbot that provides assistance with Local Law 144 and other policy documents.""}\n<situation>A lawyer is reviewing the requirements for bias audits in accordance with Local Law 144.</situation>', 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","In the context of a bias audit under Local Law 144, ""test data"" refers to the datasets specifically created or selected to evaluate the performance of automated decision-making systems, particularly in relation to potential biases. This data is used to assess how these systems operate across different demographic groups and to identify any disparities in outcomes.

Key aspects of ""test data"" in this context include:

1. **Diversity**: The test data should encompass a wide range of demographic characteristics, including but not limited to race, gender, age, and socioeconomic status. This diversity helps ensure that the audit can identify biases that may affect specific groups.

2. **Relevance**: The data should be relevant to the specific application of the automated system being audited. For example, if the system is used for hiring, the test data should include various candidate profiles that reflect the hiring criteria.

3. **Size and Volume**: The dataset should be sufficiently large to provide statistically significant results. A small sample may not accurately reflect the performance of the system across the broader population.

4. **Historical Data**: In some cases, historical data may be used to compare past outcomes with those generated by the automated system, helping to identify any shifts in bias or fairness.

5. **Controlled Conditions**: The test data should be used in a controlled manner to isolate the effects of the automated system from other variables that could influence outcomes.

By using well-constructed test data, auditors can effectively evaluate whether the automated decision-making system operates fairly and without bias, ensuring compliance with Local Law 144's requirements for transparency and accountability.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed explanation of 'test data' in the context of a bias audit, but it does not align with the ground truth, which specifies that 'test data' refers to data used for the audit that is not historical data.",1.0,0.9361295104026794,5.0,"The generated answer accurately defines 'test data' in the context of a bias audit, covers all relevant components, and provides additional useful information without any errors."
What are the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT according to Local Law 144 and other policy documents?,"A bias audit of an AEDT must, at a minimum, calculate the selection rate for each category, calculate the impact ratio for each category, ensure that the impact calculations are done separately for sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories, and indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT that are not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category.","Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Document 6: 2 
 
 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required

(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.

Here are the key requirements and considerations based on Local Law 144 and related policy documents:

1. **Definition of AEDT**: An AEDT is any computational process that assists in making employment decisions, such as hiring, promotion, or termination.

2. **Bias Audit Requirement**: Employers using AEDTs must conduct a bias audit to assess the tool's impact on different demographic groups. This audit must evaluate whether the tool produces biased outcomes based on race, gender, or other protected characteristics.

3. **Timing of Audit**: The audit must be conducted annually, and the results should be made available to the public.

4. **Third-Party Auditors**: The audit should ideally be conducted by an independent third party to ensure objectivity and credibility.

5. **Transparency**: Employers are required to disclose the use of AEDTs to candidates and employees, including information about the tool's purpose and the data it uses.

6. **Data Collection**: Employers must collect and maintain data on the outcomes of the AEDT, including demographic information, to facilitate the audit process.

7. **Remediation**: If the audit reveals significant bias, employers are expected to take corrective actions to mitigate the identified biases in the AEDT.

8. **Compliance with Other Laws**: Employers must ensure that their use of AEDTs complies with all applicable local, state, and federal laws regarding employment discrimination.

9. **Public Reporting**: The results of the bias audits must be reported in a manner that is accessible to the public, ensuring transparency and accountability.

Local Law 144 in New York City addresses the use of automated decision-making tools (ADMTs) in employment and other areas, requiring bias audits to ensure fairness and equity. The Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT) is a key component of this process.

### Purpose of the AEDT in the Bias Audit:

1. **Identifying Bias**: The AEDT is designed to assess whether the algorithms used in decision-making processes exhibit bias against specific racial or ethnic groups. This is crucial in ensuring that the tools do not perpetuate existing inequalities or discrimination.

2. **Transparency**: By auditing the AEDT, organizations can provide transparency regarding how decisions are made and the factors influencing those decisions. This helps build trust among stakeholders, including employees and job applicants.

3. **Compliance**: The bias audit helps organizations comply with Local Law 144 and other relevant regulations. It ensures that they are actively monitoring and mitigating any potential biases in their automated systems.

4. **Improving Decision-Making**: The insights gained from the bias audit can lead to improvements in the algorithms and decision-making processes, making them more equitable and effective.

5. **Data-Driven Adjustments**: The audit process often involves analyzing data related to race and ethnicity categories, allowing organizations to make data-driven adjustments to their tools and practices.

6. **Promoting Diversity and Inclusion**: By addressing potential biases, the AEDT helps organizations promote diversity and inclusion in their hiring and employment practices.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.  
 
 
 
    _________selection rate for a category________  
Impact Ratio =        selection rate of the most selected category  
 
OR 
 
  
 
     ______scoring rate for a category__________  
Impact Ratio =        scoring rate of the highest scoring category 
 
 
Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 


Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and,

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'situational', 'seed_document_id': 11, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': '{""description"": ""I am an employer who has been using an AEDT for 3 years and I will soon need an updated bias audit."", ""context"": ""Someone recently asked me about an AEDT and how often a bias audit should be conducted.

Here’s a general outline of the steps and considerations you should take into account:

### 1. **Understand Regulatory Requirements**
   - **Local and Federal Laws**: Familiarize yourself with any applicable laws and regulations regarding bias audits, such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) guidelines and any state-specific regulations.
   - **Industry Standards**: Review industry standards or best practices for bias audits, which may provide additional guidance.

### 2. **Define the Scope of the Audit**
   - **Identify the AEDT**: Clearly define which AEDT(s) will be audited.
   - **Determine the Metrics**: Decide on the specific metrics and outcomes you will analyze, such as hiring rates, promotion rates, and other relevant performance indicators.

### 3. **Data Collection**
   - **Gather Data**: Collect relevant data used by the AEDT, including demographic information, performance metrics, and any other variables that may influence outcomes.
   - **Ensure Data Quality**: Verify that the data is accurate, complete, and representative of the population.

### 4. **Conduct the Audit**
   - **Statistical Analysis**: Use statistical methods to analyze the data for potential biases. This may include regression analysis, disparity analysis, and other quantitative methods.
   - **Evaluate Outcomes**: Assess whether certain demographic groups are disproportionately affected by the AEDT’s decisions.

### 5. **Engage Stakeholders**
   - **Involve Diverse Perspectives**: Include input from various stakeholders, such as HR professionals, data scientists, and representatives from affected demographic groups.
   - **Consult Experts**: Consider hiring external auditors or consultants with expertise in bias audits and AEDTs.

### 6. **Document Findings**
   - **Report Results**: Prepare a comprehensive report detailing the findings of the audit, including any identified biases and their potential impact.
   - **Recommendations**: Provide actionable recommendations for mitigating any identified biases.

### 7. **Implement Changes**
   - **Adjust the AEDT**: Based on the audit findings, make necessary adjustments to the AEDT to reduce bias.
   - **Training and Awareness**: Train staff on the findings and the importance of bias mitigation in the hiring process.

### 8. **Monitor and Review**
   - **Ongoing Monitoring**: Establish a plan for ongoing monitoring of the AEDT to ensure that biases do not re-emerge.
   - **Regular Audits**: Schedule regular bias audits to maintain compliance and improve the tool over time.

### 9. **Transparency and Communication**
   - **Communicate Findings**: Share the results of the audit with relevant stakeholders, including employees and candidates, to promote transparency.
   - **Feedback Mechanism**: Create a mechanism for feedback on the AEDT and the audit process.

### 10. **Legal and Ethical Considerations**
   - **Privacy Compliance**: Ensure that the audit process complies with data privacy laws and ethical standards.
   - **Fairness and Equity**: Strive to uphold principles of fairness and equity throughout the audit process.

By following these steps, you can conduct a thorough and effective bias audit of your AEDT, helping to ensure fair and equitable employment practices.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed process for conducting a bias audit but does not mention the requirement of using historical data or the alternative of using test data when historical data is insufficient, which is a key aspect of the ground truth.",0.3548387096774194,0.8225054740905762,4.0,"The generated answer provides a comprehensive overview of the requirements for conducting a bias audit, addressing multiple components of the user query, but it lacks specific mention of the necessity of using historical data or test data as highlighted in the reference answer."
I'm reviewing policy documents related to bias audits and I'm seeking clarification on the definition of 'Impact Ratio'. Can you explain what 'Impact Ratio' means?,"The 'Impact Ratio' can be calculated as either the selection rate for a category divided by the selection rate of the most selected category, or the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the highest scoring category.","Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the

Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification.

the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion

Generally, it refers to a quantitative measure that assesses the effect or influence of a particular factor or intervention relative to a baseline or comparison group.

In the context of bias audits, the Impact Ratio might be used to evaluate the effectiveness of policies or practices aimed at reducing bias. It could compare the outcomes of a specific group affected by a policy against a control group that is not affected, helping to quantify the impact of that policy on bias reduction.

For example, if a bias audit is assessing a hiring policy, the Impact Ratio could measure the difference in hiring rates between different demographic groups before and after the implementation of the policy. A higher Impact Ratio might indicate a more significant positive effect of the policy on reducing bias.

New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection 
 
Notice of Adoption of Final Rule 
 
Pursuant to the authority vested in the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection by 
Sections 1043 and 2203(f) of the New York City Charter and Section 20-104(b) of the New York City 
Administrative Code, and in accordance with the requirements of Section 1043 of the New York City Charter, 
the Department amends Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York.  
 
An initial version of this rule was proposed and published on September 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on 
November 4, 2022, and comments regarding the rule were received. DCWP proposed a second version of this 
rule on December 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on January 23, 2023, and comments regarding the rule 
were received.  
 
Statement of Basis and Purpose 
 
The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP” or “Department”) is adding rules to implement 
new legislation regarding automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”). Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits 
employers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has 
been subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly 
available, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   
 
These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

A ""Bias Audit,"" as defined by § 20-870 of the Code in the context of Local Law 144, refers to a systematic evaluation of automated decision-making systems to identify and mitigate biases that may affect outcomes. Local Law 144, which was enacted in New York City, aims to ensure that algorithms and automated systems used by city agencies are fair and do not perpetuate discrimination.

The key components of a Bias Audit typically include:

1. **Assessment of Algorithms**: Evaluating the algorithms used in decision-making processes to determine if they produce biased outcomes based on race, gender, or other protected characteristics.

2. **Data Analysis**: Analyzing the data sets that feed into these algorithms to identify any inherent biases that may skew results.

3. **Transparency**: Ensuring that the processes and methodologies used in the audit are transparent and accessible to stakeholders.

4. **Recommendations**: Providing actionable recommendations to address any identified biases, which may involve adjusting algorithms, changing data inputs, or implementing new oversight mechanisms.

5. **Reporting**: Documenting the findings of the audit and making them available to the public or relevant authorities to promote accountability.

Overall, the goal of a Bias Audit under Local Law 144 is to promote fairness and equity in the use of technology by city agencies, ensuring that automated systems do not reinforce existing inequalities.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed explanation of a 'Bias Audit' but does not accurately reflect the ground truth, which simply states that it means 'Bias audit' as defined by § 20-870 of the Code.",0.2777777777777778,0.8865146040916443,5.0,"The generated answer accurately defines 'Bias Audit' as per § 20-870 of the Code, provides relevant context regarding Local Law 144, and includes comprehensive details about its components without any factual errors."

§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'situational', 'seed_document_id': 13, 'topic': 'Definitions', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': 'A chatbot is designed to provide assistance and clarification on the requirements and procedures related to bias audits for Local Law 144 and other policy documents.', 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","The **Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT)** is a critical component in the context of Local Law 144, which pertains to the regulation of automated decision-making tools used in hiring and employment practices. The purpose of the AEDT in the bias audit process is to ensure that these tools do not perpetuate or exacerbate biases against protected classes, such as race, gender, or age.

### Key Purposes of AEDT in Bias Audits:

1. **Transparency**: The AEDT helps organizations understand how their automated tools make decisions. This transparency is essential for identifying potential biases in the algorithms used.

2. **Accountability**: By conducting bias audits using the AEDT, organizations can hold themselves accountable for the outcomes produced by their automated systems. This is crucial for maintaining ethical hiring practices.

3. **Compliance**: Local Law 144 mandates that employers using AEDTs must conduct bias audits to ensure compliance with anti-discrimination laws. The AEDT serves as a framework for meeting these legal requirements.

4. **Mitigation of Bias**: The AEDT is designed to identify and mitigate biases in the decision-making process. By analyzing the data and outcomes generated by these tools, organizations can make necessary adjustments to reduce discriminatory impacts.

5. **Data-Driven Insights**: The AEDT provides organizations with data-driven insights into how their automated tools function. This information can guide improvements in both the technology and the hiring processes.

6. **Stakeholder Trust**: By demonstrating a commitment to fair and unbiased hiring practices through the use of AEDT and bias audits, organizations can build trust with stakeholders, including employees, job applicants, and the public.

### Conclusion

In summary, the AEDT plays a vital role in the bias audit process for Local Law 144 and similar policy documents by promoting transparency, accountability, compliance, and the mitigation of bias in automated employment decision-making. This ensures that organizations can leverage technology responsibly while upholding ethical standards in hiring practices.",False,"The agent incorrectly identifies AEDT as the Automated Employment Decision Tool, while the ground truth specifies it as the Applicant Employment Data Template, which focuses on assessing historical data and selection rates for bias audits.",0.4285714285714285,0.881090521812439,4.0,"The generated answer provides a comprehensive explanation of the AEDT's purpose in bias audits, covering multiple relevant aspects, but it does not explicitly mention the historical data assessment and selection rates as highlighted in the reference answer."

Violations can lead to penalties such as fines, legal action, or being barred from using the tool until compliance is achieved.

It's important to consult the specific laws and regulations applicable in your area, as they can differ significantly.",False,"The agent's definition of an automated employment decision tool is incomplete and does not match the ground truth. Additionally, the penalties described by the agent are vague and do not specify the exact amounts or conditions outlined in the ground truth.",0.4666666666666667,0.0,3.0,"The generated answer provides a partial definition of an automated employment decision tool and mentions penalties, but it lacks specific details about the penalties and does not fully align with the reference answer."
What are the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT and what changes were made in the second version of the proposed rules?,"The requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT include calculating the selection rate and impact ratio for each category. In the second version of the proposed rules, changes were made to the definition of AEDT and the requirements for an independent auditor were clarified.","Document 14: Data 
on those individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
(c) Where an AEDT scores candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion, a bias 
audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the median score for the full sample of applicants;  
(2) Calculate the scoring rate for individuals in each category;

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;",[],"{'question_type': 'double', 'seed_document_id': 14, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': [{'question': 'What are the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT?', 'answer': 'An employer or employment agency must calculate the selection rate for each category and the impact ratio for each category.'}, {'question': 'What changes were made in the second version of the proposed rules?', 'answer': 'The changes included modifying the definition of AEDT and clarifying the requirements for an independent auditor.'}], 'fake_fact': None}","The requirements for a bias audit of an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT) typically include:

An **Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT)** refers to any software or algorithm used to assist in making employment-related decisions. This can include tools for screening resumes, assessing candidates through tests, or making hiring, promotion, or termination decisions. AEDTs leverage data and algorithms to analyze candidate qualifications, predict job performance, or evaluate fit for a role, often with the aim of increasing efficiency and objectivity in the hiring process.

### Bias Audit

A **Bias Audit** is a systematic evaluation of an AEDT to identify and mitigate any biases that may affect its decision-making processes. This involves analyzing the data inputs, algorithms, and outcomes to ensure that the tool does not disproportionately disadvantage or favor any particular group based on characteristics such as race, gender, age, or other protected attributes. The goal of a bias audit is to ensure fairness, transparency, and compliance with legal and ethical standards in employment practices. 

Bias audits can include:

- **Data Analysis**: Reviewing the data used to train the algorithm for any inherent biases.
- **Algorithm Testing**: Evaluating the algorithm's outputs to see if they produce biased results.
- **Impact Assessment**: Analyzing how the tool affects different demographic groups in the hiring process.

Overall, both AEDTs and bias audits are critical in modern employment practices to promote fairness and reduce discrimination in hiring and employment decisions.",False,"The agent's definition of an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT) is generally accurate, but it lacks the emphasis on replacing discretionary decision-making. Additionally, the explanation of a bias audit is more detailed than the ground truth, which specifies an independent auditor's role, making the agent's answer less aligned with the expected response.",0.36,0.9484869241714478,5.0,"The generated answer accurately defines both an automated employment decision tool and a bias audit, covering all components of the user query with correct and comprehensive information."

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.

What are the requirements for a bias audit and what is test data in the context of a bias audit?,The requirements for a bias audit include calculating the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category and comparing the selection rates to determine an impact ratio. Test data in the context of a bias audit refers to data used to conduct the audit that is not historical data.,"Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Document 6: 2 
 
 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.",[],"{'question_type': 'double', 'seed_document_id': 5, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': [{'question': 'What are the requirements for a bias audit?', 'answer': 'A bias audit must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category and compare the selection rates to determine an impact ratio.'}, {'question': 'What is test data in the context of a bias audit?', 'answer': 'Test data is data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.'}], 'fake_fact': None}","A bias audit is a systematic evaluation of algorithms, models, or systems to identify and mitigate biases that may lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes. The requirements for conducting a bias audit can vary depending on the context, but generally include the following:

### Requirements for a Bias Audit

1. **Clear Objectives**:
   - Define the purpose of the audit, including what biases are being assessed and the desired outcomes.

2. **Data Collection**:
   - Gather relevant data that reflects the population or context in which the model will be used. This includes both training data and any additional data needed for testing.

3. **Stakeholder Involvement**:
   - Engage stakeholders, including affected communities, domain experts, and ethicists, to understand potential biases and their implications.

4. **Model Transparency**:
   - Ensure that the model's architecture, features, and decision-making processes are transparent and accessible for evaluation.

5. **Bias Metrics**:
   - Establish metrics to quantify bias, such as disparate impact, equal opportunity, or other fairness metrics relevant to the context.

6. **Testing Procedures**:
   - Develop a systematic approach for testing the model against the defined metrics, including statistical tests and validation techniques.

7. **Documentation**:
   - Maintain thorough documentation of the audit process, findings, and any changes made to the model or data as a result.

8. **Remediation Strategies**:
   - Identify and implement strategies to mitigate identified biases, which may include re-sampling, re-weighting, or model adjustments.

9. **Continuous Monitoring**:
   - Establish a plan for ongoing monitoring and re-evaluation of the model to ensure that biases do not re-emerge over time.

### Test Data in the Context of a Bias Audit

**Test Data** refers to the dataset used to evaluate the performance of a model during the bias audit. It is crucial for assessing how the model behaves across different demographic groups or categories. Key aspects of test data include:

1. **Diversity**:
   - The test data should be representative of the diverse populations that the model will encounter in real-world applications. This includes various demographic factors such as race, gender, age, socioeconomic status, etc.

2. **Size**:
   - The dataset should be sufficiently large to provide statistically significant results, allowing for reliable conclusions about bias.

3. **Labeling**:
   - Test data should be accurately labeled, especially if the audit involves supervised learning. This ensures that the evaluation metrics can be correctly calculated.

4. **Segmentation**:
   - The test data may need to be segmented based on different attributes to assess how the model performs across various groups.

5. **Baseline Comparison**:
   - Establish a baseline for comparison, which may involve using a previously validated model or a set of expected outcomes.

In summary, a bias audit requires a structured approach to identify and mitigate biases in algorithms, with a focus on clear objectives, stakeholder involvement, and robust testing procedures. Test data plays a critical role in this process by providing a means to evaluate the model's fairness and performance across different demographic groups.",False,"The agent's answer provides a comprehensive overview of bias audit requirements and test data, but it does not specifically mention calculating selection rates for race/ethnicity and sex categories or the distinction that test data should not be historical data, which are key points in the ground truth.",0.1162790697674418,0.8877506852149963,3.0,"The generated answer provides a detailed overview of bias audit requirements and test data, addressing multiple components of the query, but it includes some extraneous information and lacks specific mention of calculating selection rates and impact ratios as highlighted in the reference answer."

A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.

**Test Data** refers to a set of data used to validate the performance and accuracy of a system, model, or algorithm. In the context of software testing, particularly for algorithms and machine learning models, test data is used to evaluate how well the system performs under various conditions. It typically includes:

- **Input Data**: The data fed into the system to assess its functionality.
- **Expected Output**: The anticipated results that the system should produce based on the input data.
- **Diversity**: A range of scenarios to ensure comprehensive testing, including edge cases and typical use cases.

### Requirements for a Bias Audit of an Automated Decision-Making Tool (AEDT)

A bias audit of an AEDT involves a systematic evaluation to identify and mitigate biases that may affect decision-making processes. The following requirements are typically considered:

1. **Data Collection**:
   - **Diverse Test Data**: Ensure that the test data includes a representative sample of all relevant demographic groups to assess potential biases.
   - **Historical Data**: Use historical data to understand past decisions and their outcomes, which can reveal patterns of bias.

2. **Bias Metrics**:
   - **Fairness Metrics**: Define and apply fairness metrics (e.g., demographic parity, equal opportunity) to quantify bias in the model's predictions.
   - **Performance Metrics**: Evaluate the model's performance across different demographic groups to identify disparities.

3. **Transparency**:
   - **Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation of the data sources, model design, and decision-making processes.
   - **Explainability**: Ensure that the model's decisions can be explained in understandable terms, allowing stakeholders to assess fairness.

4. **Stakeholder Involvement**:
   - **Engagement**: Involve diverse stakeholders, including affected communities, in the audit process to gather insights and perspectives on potential biases.
   - **Feedback Mechanisms**: Establish channels for ongoing feedback from users and affected parties.

5. **Iterative Testing**:
   - **Continuous Monitoring**: Implement a process for ongoing monitoring and re-evaluation of the AEDT to identify and address biases as they arise.
   - **Model Updates**: Regularly update the model and its training data to reflect changes in societal norms and values.

6. **Regulatory Compliance**:
   - **Adherence to Standards**: Ensure compliance with relevant laws, regulations, and ethical guidelines regarding fairness and non-discrimination.

7. **Remediation Strategies**:
   - **Bias Mitigation Techniques**: Apply techniques to reduce identified biases, such as re-weighting, data augmentation, or algorithmic adjustments.

By adhering to these requirements, organizations can conduct thorough bias audits of AEDTs, helping to ensure fair and equitable decision-making processes.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed explanation of 'test data' and requirements for a bias audit, but it does not align with the ground truth, which specifies that test data should not include historical data and emphasizes calculating selection rates and impact ratios for specific categories.",0.1607142857142857,0.9007607698440552,3.0,"The generated answer provides a detailed definition of 'test data' and outlines several requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT, but it includes significant inaccuracies, such as the mention of historical data, which contradicts the reference answer's definition."

posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'double', 'seed_document_id': 18, 'topic': 'Definitions', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': [{'question': 'What is the definition of test data?', 'answer': 'Test data means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.'}, {'question': 'When can an employer or employment agency rely on a bias audit that uses test data?', 'answer': 'An employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.'}], 'fake_fact': None}","**Test Data Definition:**
Test data refers to a set of information or scenarios used to evaluate the performance, accuracy, and fairness of a system, process, or model. In the context of employment practices, test data can include various metrics related to hiring, promotion, and other employment decisions, often used to assess potential biases in these processes.

**When Employers or Employment Agencies Can Rely on a Bias Audit Using Test Data:**
Employers or employment agencies can rely on a bias audit that uses test data under the following conditions:

1. **Relevance:** The test data must be relevant to the specific employment practices being audited. It should reflect the demographics and characteristics of the applicant pool.

2. **Comprehensiveness:** The audit should cover a wide range of scenarios and variables to ensure a thorough assessment of potential biases.

3. **Statistical Validity:** The methodologies used in the audit should be statistically sound, ensuring that the findings are reliable and can be generalized to the broader context.

4. **Transparency:** The process and criteria used for the audit should be transparent, allowing stakeholders to understand how conclusions were drawn.

5. **Compliance with Legal Standards:** The audit must comply with applicable laws and regulations regarding employment practices and anti-discrimination.

6. **Actionable Insights:** The results of the audit should provide actionable insights that employers can use to mitigate bias and improve their hiring processes.

7. **Regular Updates:** Employers should conduct bias audits regularly to account for changes in the workforce, societal norms, and legal standards.

By adhering to these conditions, employers and employment agencies can effectively use bias audits based on test data to identify and address potential biases in their employment practices.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed explanation of test data and conditions for bias audits, but it does not accurately reflect the ground truth definition of test data or the specific conditions under which employers can rely on a bias audit using test data.",0.28125,0.9309070706367492,3.0,"The generated answer provides a detailed definition of test data and outlines conditions for relying on a bias audit, but it does not directly address the specific reliance on test data when historical data is insufficient, leading to minor inaccuracies."

Here are some common methods for providing notice:

### Methods of Providing Notice:
1. **Email Notification**: Sending a direct email to the candidate outlining the use of AEDTs in the hiring process.
2. **Job Postings**: Including information about AEDTs in job advertisements or postings.
3. **Application Forms**: Adding a notice section in the application forms that informs candidates about the use of AEDTs.
4. **Company Website**: Providing information on the company’s careers page or a dedicated section about their hiring practices.
5. **In-Person Communication**: Informing candidates during interviews or recruitment events.
6. **Written Communication**: Sending a formal letter or notice to candidates who are being considered for a position.

### Information to be Made Publicly Available:
Before using an AEDT, employers and employment agencies must make certain information publicly available, which typically includes:

1. **Description of the AEDT**: A clear explanation of the tool being used, including its purpose and how it functions.
2. **Criteria Used**: Information on the specific criteria or factors that the AEDT evaluates in candidates.
3. **Data Sources**: Disclosure of the types of data that the AEDT uses to make decisions.

What is the definition of test data and what are the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT?,"Test data means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. A bias audit must calculate the selection rate and impact ratio for each category, including sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories.","Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results.

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

**Test Data** refers to a set of data used to validate the functionality, performance, and reliability of a system, application, or model. In the context of software testing, test data is specifically designed to ensure that the system behaves as expected under various conditions. It can include:

- **Input Data**: Data that is fed into the system to trigger specific behaviors or outcomes.
- **Expected Output**: The anticipated results that should occur when the input data is processed.
- **Edge Cases**: Uncommon or extreme scenarios that test the limits of the system.
- **Real-World Data**: Actual data collected from users or operational environments to assess performance in realistic conditions.

### Requirements for a Bias Audit of an Automated Decision-Making Tool (AEDT)

A bias audit of an AEDT typically involves several key requirements to ensure that the system operates fairly and without discrimination. These may include:

1. **Data Collection and Transparency**:
   - Comprehensive documentation of the data sources used for training and testing the AEDT.
   - Clear identification of any potential biases in the data, including demographic imbalances.

2. **Diverse Test Data**:
   - Use of diverse and representative test data that reflects the population the AEDT will serve.
   - Inclusion of various demographic groups to assess how the system performs across different segments.

3. **Bias Metrics**:
   - Establishment of specific metrics to measure bias, such as disparate impact, equal opportunity, and predictive parity.
   - Use of statistical tests to evaluate whether outcomes differ significantly across demographic groups.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Regular evaluation of the model's performance using the established metrics.
   - Comparison of outcomes across different demographic groups to identify any disparities.

5. **Stakeholder Involvement**:
   - Engagement with stakeholders, including affected communities, to gather insights and feedback on the AEDT's impact.
   - Inclusion of interdisciplinary teams (e.g., ethicists, data scientists, domain experts) in the audit process.

6. **Remediation Strategies**:
   - Development of strategies to mitigate identified biases, such as re-sampling, re-weighting, or model adjustments.
   - Implementation of ongoing monitoring to ensure that bias mitigation strategies are effective over time.

7. **Documentation and Reporting**:
   - Comprehensive reporting of the audit findings, including identified biases, their potential impacts, and the steps taken to address them.
   - Transparency in the audit process to build trust with users and stakeholders.

8. **Compliance with Regulations**:
   - Adherence to relevant laws and regulations regarding fairness, accountability, and transparency in automated decision-making.

By following these requirements, organizations can conduct thorough bias audits of their AEDTs, helping to ensure that these systems operate fairly and equitably.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed explanation of test data and bias audit requirements but does not align with the ground truth, which specifies that test data should not be historical and emphasizes calculating selection rates and impact ratios for specific categories.",0.660377358490566,0.9345226287841796,2.0,The generated answer provides a detailed definition of test data but fails to accurately address the specific requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT as outlined in the reference answer.

category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.

audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.",[],"{'question_type': 'double', 'seed_document_id': 17, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': [{'question': 'What is the purpose of a bias audit?', 'answer': 'A bias audit must calculate the impact ratio for each category and ensure that the calculations separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race.'}, {'question': 'When can an employer rely on a bias audit that uses test data?', 'answer': 'An employer can rely on a bias audit that uses test data if there is insufficient historical data available to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.'}], 'fake_fact': None}","A bias audit is a systematic evaluation of an organization's processes, policies, and practices to identify and mitigate biases, particularly in areas like hiring, promotions, performance evaluations, and pay equity. The purpose of a bias audit includes:

1. **Identifying Bias**: To uncover any unconscious biases that may affect decision-making and outcomes within the organization.

2. **Promoting Fairness**: To ensure that all employees and candidates are treated equitably, regardless of their background, gender, race, or other characteristics.

3. **Enhancing Diversity and Inclusion**: To create a more diverse and inclusive workplace by addressing systemic barriers that may disadvantage certain groups.

4. **Improving Organizational Culture**: To foster a culture of fairness and respect, which can enhance employee morale and retention.

5. **Compliance and Risk Management**: To help organizations comply with legal and regulatory requirements related to equal employment opportunity and anti-discrimination laws.

6. **Data-Driven Decision Making**: To provide insights and data that can inform better decision-making and policy development.

### When Employers Can Rely on a Bias Audit:

1. **Before Major Hiring Initiatives**: Employers can conduct a bias audit before launching new recruitment campaigns to ensure that their processes are fair and inclusive.

2. **During Policy Reviews**: When reviewing or updating policies related to promotions, pay, or performance evaluations, a bias audit can help identify potential biases in existing practices.

3. **Post-Incident Analysis**: After experiencing issues related to diversity or discrimination claims, organizations can use a bias audit to assess and address underlying problems.

4. **Regular Assessments**: Employers may conduct bias audits on a regular basis (e.g., annually) to continuously monitor and improve their practices.

5. **Before Mergers or Acquisitions**: When merging with or acquiring another company, a bias audit can help identify and align cultural and operational differences.

6. **To Meet Stakeholder Expectations**: Organizations may conduct bias audits to demonstrate their commitment to diversity and inclusion to stakeholders, including investors, customers, and employees.

By relying on bias audits, employers can take proactive steps to create a more equitable workplace, ultimately benefiting both the organization and its employees.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed explanation of the purpose of a bias audit and when it can be relied upon, but it does not align with the ground truth, which specifically mentions calculating impact ratios and the use of test data in the absence of sufficient historical data.",0.0,0.8818491101264954,3.0,"The generated answer provides a comprehensive overview of the purpose of a bias audit and when employers can rely on it, but it does not specifically mention calculating the impact ratio or the use of test data as noted in the reference answer."

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.

An **Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT)** refers to any software or algorithm used in the hiring process to assist in making employment decisions. This can include tools that screen resumes, assess candidates through tests, or even make recommendations for hiring or promotions. AEDTs leverage data and algorithms to analyze candidate qualifications, often aiming to improve efficiency and reduce human bias in the hiring process. However, they can also introduce new biases if not designed and monitored carefully.

### Bias Audit

A **Bias Audit** is a systematic evaluation of an AEDT to identify and mitigate any biases that may affect its decision-making processes. This involves analyzing the data inputs, algorithms, and outcomes to ensure that the tool does not disproportionately disadvantage any particular group based on characteristics such as race, gender, age, or other protected attributes. Bias audits can include reviewing the training data for representativeness, testing the tool's outputs for fairness, and making adjustments to the algorithm or its parameters to promote equitable outcomes. The goal is to ensure that the AEDT operates fairly and complies with legal and ethical standards.",False,The agent's definitions of 'Automated Employment Decision Tool' and 'Bias Audit' are not fully aligned with the ground truth. The agent's definition lacks specificity regarding the computational processes involved and the role of an independent auditor in a bias audit.,0.5909090909090909,0.7652750611305237,4.0,"The generated answer accurately defines both 'Automated Employment Decision Tool' and 'Bias Audit,' covering all components of the query with minimal errors, though it could be more concise."
What are the requirements for a bias audit and what is test data?,The requirements for a bias audit include calculating the selection rate and impact ratio for each category. Test data is the data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.,"Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Document 6: 2 
 
 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

A bias audit is a systematic evaluation of algorithms, models, or systems to identify and mitigate biases that may lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes. Here are some common requirements for conducting a bias audit:

1. **Clear Objectives**:
   - Define the purpose of the audit and what specific biases you are looking to identify (e.g., racial, gender, socioeconomic).

2. **Data Collection**:
   - Gather relevant data that reflects the population affected by the algorithm. This includes both input data and output results.

3. **Diverse Stakeholder Involvement**:
   - Involve a diverse group of stakeholders, including data scientists, ethicists, domain experts, and representatives from affected communities.

4. **Bias Metrics**:
   - Establish metrics to measure bias, such as disparate impact, equal opportunity, or predictive parity.

5. **Model Transparency**:
   - Ensure that the model is interpretable and that its decision-making process can be understood.

6. **Testing Framework**:
   - Develop a framework for testing the model against the defined bias metrics, including statistical tests and validation techniques.

7. **Documentation**:
   - Maintain thorough documentation of the audit process, findings, and any changes made to the model or data.

8. **Remediation Strategies**:
   - Identify and implement strategies to mitigate identified biases, such as re-weighting data, modifying algorithms, or improving data collection practices.

9. **Continuous Monitoring**:
   - Establish a plan for ongoing monitoring and re-evaluation of the model to ensure that biases do not re-emerge over time.

### Test Data

Test data refers to a subset of data used to evaluate the performance of a model or algorithm. In the context of a bias audit, test data should be carefully selected to ensure it is representative of the population and includes diverse groups. Here are some key aspects of test data:

1. **Representativeness**:
   - The test data should reflect the diversity of the real-world population that the model will serve, including various demographics (e.g., age, gender, ethnicity).

2. **Balanced Distribution**:
   - Ensure that the test data includes a balanced distribution of different groups to accurately assess the model's performance across these groups.

3. **Labeling**:
   - Test data should be labeled accurately to allow for meaningful evaluation against the defined bias metrics.

4. **Size**:
   - The test dataset should be large enough to provide statistically significant results, allowing for reliable conclusions about bias.

5. **Real-World Scenarios**:
   - Include scenarios that the model is likely to encounter in real-world applications to assess its performance in practical situations.

6. **Segmentation**:
   - Consider segmenting the test data to analyze performance across different groups or conditions, which can help identify specific areas of bias.

By adhering to these requirements for a bias audit and carefully selecting test data, organizations can better understand and mitigate biases in their algorithms and models.",False,"The agent's answer provides a comprehensive overview of bias audit requirements and test data, but it does not mention calculating the selection rate and impact ratio, nor does it specify that test data should not be historical data, which are key points in the ground truth.",0.4,0.8485719561576843,4.0,"The generated answer provides a comprehensive overview of the requirements for a bias audit and adequately explains test data, addressing all components of the user query with minimal errors."

calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 12: Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit. The vendor provides historical data regarding 
applicant selection that the vendor has collected from multiple employers to an independent auditor who 
will conduct a bias audit as follows:

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT.

An **employment decision** refers to any choice made by an employer regarding an individual's employment status or conditions. This can include hiring, promotion, demotion, termination, compensation, job assignments, and other aspects of employment. Essentially, it encompasses any action that affects an employee's or job applicant's relationship with an employer.

### Requirements for Using an Automated Employment Decision Tool

The requirements for using an **automated employment decision tool (AEDT)** can vary by jurisdiction, but generally include the following key considerations:

1. **Transparency**: Employers should disclose the use of automated tools in the hiring process. This includes informing candidates that their applications will be evaluated using such tools.

2. **Fairness and Non-Discrimination**: The tool must comply with anti-discrimination laws. Employers should ensure that the tool does not disproportionately disadvantage any protected group based on race, gender, age, or other characteristics.

3. **Validation**: Employers should validate the tool to ensure it accurately predicts job performance and does not introduce bias. This often involves testing the tool against real-world outcomes.

4. **Data Privacy**: Employers must adhere to data protection regulations, ensuring that personal data collected through the tool is handled securely and in compliance with privacy laws.

5. **Human Oversight**: Many jurisdictions recommend or require that human judgment be involved in the final employment decision, even when automated tools are used.

6. **Record Keeping**: Employers may be required to maintain records of the tool's use, including data on its effectiveness and any adverse impacts it may have had.

7. **Compliance with Local Laws**: Specific regulations may apply depending on the location, such as the New York City law requiring employers to conduct a bias audit of AEDTs.

It's essential for employers to stay informed about the legal landscape surrounding automated employment decision tools, as regulations can evolve and vary significantly by region.",False,"The agent's answer provides a general definition of 'employment decision' and outlines various requirements for using automated employment decision tools, but it does not match the specific definition and legal requirements stated in the ground truth, particularly regarding the bias audit and public disclosure.",0.2631578947368421,0.775653064250946,4.0,"The generated answer provides a comprehensive definition of 'employment decision' and addresses the requirements for using an automated employment decision tool, but it lacks the specific mention of the bias audit requirement and its public disclosure, which are critical components of the reference answer."
What are the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT and what is test data?,The requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT are to calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category and compare the selection rates to determine an impact ratio. Test data is data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.,"Document 6: 2 
 
 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results. 
 
New material is underlined. 
[Deleted material is in brackets.] 
 
“Shall” and “must” denote mandatory requirements and may be used interchangeably in the rules of this 
department, unless otherwise specified or unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.",[],"{'question_type': 'double', 'seed_document_id': 6, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': [{'question': 'What are the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT?', 'answer': 'A bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category and compare the selection rates to determine an impact ratio.'}, {'question': 'What is test data?', 'answer': 'Test data is data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.'}], 'fake_fact': None}","A bias audit of an Automated Decision-Making Tool (AEDT) typically involves several key requirements and considerations to ensure that the tool operates fairly and without discrimination. Here are the main components:

### Requirements for a Bias Audit of an AEDT:

1. **Data Collection**:
   - **Diverse Data Sets**: Collect data that represents a wide range of demographics, including race, gender, age, socioeconomic status, etc.
   - **Historical Data**: Use historical data to understand past decisions and their outcomes.

2. **Transparency**:
   - **Algorithm Disclosure**: Provide information about the algorithms used, including their design, purpose, and decision-making processes.
   - **Model Interpretability**: Ensure that the model's decisions can be understood and explained.

3. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - **Fairness Metrics**: Define and use metrics to assess fairness, such as disparate impact, equal opportunity, and predictive parity.
   - **Performance Metrics**: Evaluate the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant performance indicators.

4. **Testing Procedures**:
   - **Simulations**: Conduct simulations to test how the AEDT performs under various scenarios and with different demographic groups.
   - **Stress Testing**: Assess the model's robustness against edge cases and outliers.

5. **Stakeholder Involvement**:
   - **Engagement**: Involve stakeholders, including affected communities, in the audit process to gather insights and feedback.
   - **Expert Review**: Consult with experts in ethics, law, and data science to evaluate the audit findings.

6. **Documentation**:
   - **Audit Report**: Prepare a comprehensive report detailing the audit process, findings, and recommendations for improvement.
   - **Action Plan**: Develop a plan to address any identified biases or issues.

7. **Compliance**:
   - **Regulatory Standards**: Ensure that the audit complies with relevant laws and regulations regarding fairness and discrimination.

### Test Data:

**Test data** refers to the data used during the bias audit to evaluate the performance and fairness of the AEDT. It typically includes:

1. **Representative Samples**: A subset of data that reflects the diversity of the population the AEDT will serve.
2. **Controlled Variables**: Data that allows for the isolation of specific factors to assess their impact on the model's decisions.
3. **Synthetic Data**: In some cases, synthetic data may be generated to fill gaps or to create scenarios that are underrepresented in the historical data.
4. **Ground Truth Labels**: Data that includes known outcomes to compare against the AEDT's predictions, allowing for an assessment of accuracy and fairness.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.",[],"{'question_type': 'double', 'seed_document_id': 17, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': [{'question': 'What is the purpose of a bias audit?', 'answer': 'A bias audit is conducted to calculate the impact ratio and selection rate of an AEDT on different categories such as sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectional categories.'}, {'question': 'Under what circumstances can an employer rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from other employers?', 'answer': 'An employer can rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses historical data from other employers if they provided their own historical data or if they have never used the AEDT.'}], 'fake_fact': None}","A bias audit is a systematic evaluation of algorithms, processes, or practices to identify and mitigate biases that may lead to unfair treatment of individuals based on characteristics such as race, gender, age, or other protected attributes. The primary purposes of a bias audit include:

1. **Identifying Bias**: To uncover any discriminatory patterns or outcomes in hiring, promotions, pay, or other employment practices.
  
2. **Mitigating Risk**: To reduce the risk of legal repercussions and reputational damage associated with biased practices.

3. **Enhancing Fairness**: To promote equitable treatment of all employees and candidates, fostering a more inclusive workplace.

4. **Improving Decision-Making**: To ensure that decisions are based on relevant and fair criteria, leading to better organizational outcomes.

5. **Compliance**: To help organizations comply with legal and regulatory requirements related to equal employment opportunity and anti-discrimination laws.

### Circumstances for Relying on Historical Data from Other Employers

Employers may rely on historical data from other employers in a bias audit under certain conditions:

1. **Benchmarking**: When comparing their practices against industry standards or norms to identify areas for improvement.

2. **Research Purposes**: If the data is used in a research context to understand broader trends in bias and discrimination across the industry.

3. **Statistical Analysis**: When conducting statistical analyses that require a larger dataset to identify patterns or validate findings.

4. **Data Privacy and Compliance**: Ensuring that the use of historical data complies with data protection laws and does not violate confidentiality agreements.

5. **Relevance**: The historical data must be relevant to the specific context of the employer's practices and the demographic groups being analyzed.

6. **Quality of Data**: The data should be reliable, valid, and collected in a manner that minimizes bias itself.

Employers should exercise caution when using historical data from other employers, ensuring that it is appropriate for their specific context and that it does not perpetuate existing biases. Additionally, they should be transparent about the sources and methodologies used in the audit process.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed explanation of a bias audit's purpose and circumstances for using historical data, but it does not align with the ground truth, which specifically mentions calculating impact ratios and selection rates, and conditions under which historical data can be used.",0.0666666666666666,0.9554661512374878,3.0,"The generated answer provides a comprehensive overview of the purpose of a bias audit and includes relevant circumstances for relying on historical data, but it lacks specific details about calculating impact ratios and selection rates as mentioned in the reference answer."

This can include tools for screening resumes, assessing candidates, predicting job performance, or making hiring recommendations.

### Definition:
An AEDT typically involves the following characteristics:
- **Automation**: The tool operates with minimal human intervention.
- **Data-Driven**: It relies on data inputs, which can include resumes, assessments, and other candidate information.
- **Decision-Making**: It influences or determines employment decisions, such as hiring, promotions, or terminations.

### Requirements for Using AEDTs:
The requirements for using AEDTs can vary by jurisdiction, but common considerations include:

1. **Transparency**: Employers may need to disclose the use of AEDTs to candidates and provide information about how the tool works.

2. **Fairness and Non-Discrimination**: Employers must ensure that the tool does not discriminate against protected classes under employment law. This often involves conducting impact assessments to evaluate the tool's effects on different demographic groups.

3. **Validation**: Employers should validate the tool to ensure it accurately predicts job performance and is relevant to the specific job for which it is used.

4. **Data Privacy**: Compliance with data protection regulations (like GDPR or CCPA) is essential, ensuring that candidate data is handled securely and ethically.

5. **Human Oversight**: Many guidelines recommend that human judgment should remain a part of the decision-making process, especially in critical employment decisions.

6. **Record-Keeping**: Employers may be required to maintain records of the tool's use, including data inputs and decision outcomes, to demonstrate compliance with legal standards.

7. **Regular Review**: Continuous monitoring and updating of the AEDT may be necessary to ensure it remains effective and compliant with evolving laws and standards.

### Conclusion:
Using AEDTs can enhance efficiency in hiring processes, but it is crucial for employers to navigate the legal and ethical landscape carefully to avoid potential pitfalls related to bias, discrimination, and privacy.",False,"The agent's answer provides a general definition and requirements for automated employment decision tools, but it does not match the specific legal definition and requirements outlined in the ground truth, which includes details about bias audits and public disclosure.",0.25,0.8229013085365295,4.0,"The generated answer provides a comprehensive definition of an automated employment decision tool and outlines relevant requirements, but it lacks specific details about bias audits and public disclosure that are critical to the reference answer."

This can include tools that analyze resumes, assess candidate qualifications, or predict job performance based on various data inputs.

### Key Features of AEDTs:
- **Automation**: The tool automates part of the decision-making process.
- **Data-Driven**: It relies on data analysis, often using machine learning or statistical methods.
- **Impact on Employment Decisions**: It significantly influences or determines the outcome of employment-related decisions.

### Requirements and Regulations:
In some jurisdictions, particularly in New York City and other areas, there are specific requirements for AEDTs, including:

1. **Bias Audits**: Regular assessments to ensure the tool does not discriminate against protected classes.
2. **Transparency**: Employers may need to disclose the use of AEDTs to candidates.
3. **Fairness**: Ensuring that the tool is fair and does not disproportionately disadvantage any group.

### Penalties for Violating Requirements:
Penalties for non-compliance with AEDT regulations can vary by jurisdiction but may include:

- **Fines**: Monetary penalties imposed on employers for failing to comply with regulations.
- **Legal Action**: Employees or candidates may file lawsuits against employers for discriminatory practices.
- **Injunctions**: Courts may issue orders to halt the use of non-compliant tools.
- **Reputational Damage**: Companies may face public backlash or damage to their reputation.

It's essential for employers to stay informed about the specific laws and regulations governing AEDTs in their area to avoid these penalties.",False,"The agent's definition of an automated employment decision tool is generally accurate, but it lacks the specific details about civil penalties and their amounts for violations, which are crucial to the ground truth answer.",0.56,0.7882657647132874,4.0,"The generated answer provides a comprehensive definition of an automated employment decision tool and discusses relevant penalties, but it lacks specific details about the maximum penalties as outlined in the reference answer."
What is the relationship between the definition of 'test data' in a bias audit and the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT?,"In a bias audit, 'test data' refers to the data used for the audit that is not historical data. On the other hand, a bias audit of an AEDT requires calculating the selection rate and impact ratio for each category, including sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectional categories. Therefore, the definition of 'test data' in a bias audit is distinct from the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT, but both are crucial components of ensuring fairness and identifying potential biases in automated systems.","Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

### Definition of 'Test Data' in a Bias Audit

1. **Test Data**: In the context of a bias audit, 'test data' refers to the dataset used to evaluate the performance of the AEDT. This data should be representative of the population that the AEDT will serve and should include diverse demographic groups to ensure that the audit can identify any potential biases in the tool's outputs.

2. **Characteristics**: The test data should be comprehensive, covering various scenarios and edge cases. It should also be free from biases itself to ensure that the audit results are valid and reliable.

### Requirements for a Bias Audit of an AEDT

1. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The requirements for a bias audit typically mandate a thorough evaluation of the AEDT's decision-making processes, including how it uses input data and how it generates outputs.

2. **Diversity and Representation**: The audit must ensure that the test data used reflects the diversity of the population affected by the AEDT. This is essential for identifying any disparities in outcomes across different demographic groups.

3. **Transparency and Accountability**: The audit process should be transparent, with clear documentation of the test data used, the methodologies applied, and the findings. This helps in holding the developers accountable for the AEDT's performance.

4. **Mitigation Strategies**: The audit should not only identify biases but also recommend strategies for mitigating them, which may involve revising the test data or the algorithms used in the AEDT.

### Relationship Between the Two

- **Alignment**: The definition of 'test data' directly informs the requirements for a bias audit. The quality and characteristics of the test data are foundational to the audit's effectiveness in identifying biases.

- **Impact on Outcomes**: The choice of test data can significantly impact the audit's findings. If the test data is not representative or is biased, the audit may fail to uncover critical issues, leading to flawed conclusions about the AEDT's fairness and effectiveness.

- **Feedback Loop**: Insights gained from the bias audit can lead to improvements in the definition and selection of test data for future audits, creating a continuous feedback loop aimed at enhancing the fairness of AEDTs.

Here’s a breakdown:

### Similarities:

1. **Transparency**: Both requirements emphasize the need for transparency in the use of AEDTs. Employers and agencies must ensure that candidates are aware of the tools being used in the hiring process.

2. **Compliance**: Both aspects are part of broader regulatory frameworks aimed at ensuring fair hiring practices and protecting candidates' rights.

3. **Information Sharing**: Both require the sharing of information about the use of AEDTs, albeit in different contexts (publicly on websites vs. directly with candidates).

### Differences:

1. **Scope of Information**:
   - **Publicly Available Information**: This typically includes details about the types of AEDTs used, their purpose, and how they impact the hiring process. It may also cover the criteria for selection and any relevant metrics or outcomes.
   - **Notice to Candidates**: This is more focused on informing individual candidates about the specific use of an AEDT in their application process. It may include details on how the tool will be used to evaluate their application and any rights they have regarding the decision-making process.

2. **Format and Delivery**:
   - **Publicly Available Information**: This is usually presented in a static format on the employer's website, accessible to anyone interested in applying for a position.
   - **Notice to Candidates**: This is typically delivered directly to candidates, often in a more personalized manner, such as through email or during the application process.

3. **Timing**:
   - **Publicly Available Information**: This information should be available before candidates apply, allowing them to make informed decisions about whether to pursue employment with the organization.
   - **Notice to Candidates**: This notice is provided at the point of application or shortly thereafter, ensuring that candidates are aware of the AEDT's use in their specific case.

4. **Regulatory Focus**:
   - **Publicly Available Information**: This may be driven by broader regulatory requirements aimed at ensuring that organizations are upfront about their hiring practices.
   - **Notice to Candidates**: This is often more focused on individual rights and ensuring that candidates understand how their data will be used and how decisions will be made.

### Conclusion:

In summary, while both the requirements for publicly available information and the notice to candidates share a common goal of promoting transparency and fairness in the hiring process, they differ in their scope, format, timing, and regulatory focus. Employers and employment agencies must navigate both aspects to ensure compliance and maintain trust with potential candidates.",False,The agent's answer does not accurately address the specific requirements for publicly available information regarding the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and the options for providing notice to candidates.

Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and,

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'compare', 'seed_document_id': 11, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': [{'question': 'What is a bias audit?', 'answer': 'A bias audit is a process used to assess the impact of an AEDT on different categories, such as sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectional categories.'}, {'question': 'What are the data requirements for a bias audit?', 'answer': 'A bias audit must use historical data of the AEDT, but if insufficient historical data is available, an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data.'}], 'fake_fact': None}","The data requirements for a bias audit are closely related to the process of assessing the impact of Automated and Decision Technologies (AEDT) on different categories, such as race, gender, age, and other demographic factors. Here’s how they connect:

### 1. **Data Collection**:
   - **Comprehensive Data**: To conduct a bias audit, it’s essential to collect comprehensive data that reflects the diversity of the population affected by the AEDT. This includes demographic information and relevant contextual data.
   - **Relevance to Impact Assessment**: The same data is necessary for assessing the impact of the AEDT on different categories. Without adequate data, it’s impossible to determine how different groups are affected by the technology.

### 2. **Disaggregation of Data**:
   - **Identifying Bias**: A bias audit requires disaggregating data by various demographic categories to identify potential biases in the outcomes produced by the AEDT.
   - **Impact Analysis**: Similarly, assessing the impact of the AEDT on different categories necessitates disaggregated data to understand how different groups experience the technology’s effects.

### 3. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - **Bias Detection**: Statistical methods are employed in bias audits to detect disparities in outcomes across different demographic groups.
   - **Impact Evaluation**: The same statistical techniques can be used to evaluate the overall impact of the AEDT, helping to identify whether certain groups are disproportionately affected, either positively or negatively.

### 4. **Benchmarking and Comparison**:
   - **Establishing Baselines**: A bias audit often involves comparing outcomes against established benchmarks or standards to identify deviations.
   - **Contextualizing Impact**: In assessing impact, it’s crucial to compare the AEDT’s outcomes against those of traditional methods or other technologies to contextualize its effects on different categories.

### 5. **Feedback Loops**:
   - **Iterative Process**: The findings from a bias audit can inform adjustments to the AEDT, which can then be re-evaluated for impact. This iterative process ensures that the technology evolves to minimize bias and improve outcomes for all demographic groups.
   - **Continuous Monitoring**: Ongoing data collection and analysis are necessary for both bias audits and impact assessments to ensure that any emerging biases or impacts are promptly addressed.

### 6. **Regulatory and Ethical Considerations**:
   - **Compliance**: Both processes must adhere to legal and ethical standards regarding data privacy and fairness, necessitating careful consideration of how data is collected, stored, and analyzed.
   - **Transparency**: Clear documentation of data sources and methodologies is essential for both bias audits and impact assessments to ensure transparency and accountability.

### Conclusion:
In summary, the data requirements for a bias audit and the process of assessing the impact of AEDT are interdependent. Both require comprehensive, disaggregated data and robust analytical methods to ensure that the technology is fair and equitable across different demographic categories. By aligning these processes, organizations can better understand and mitigate biases while maximizing the positive impacts of their technologies.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed explanation of the relationship between data requirements for a bias audit and assessing the impact of AEDT, but it does not accurately reflect the ground truth, which emphasizes the use of historical data and the potential reliance on test data when historical data is insufficient.

Section 1.  Chapter 5 of Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York is amended to add Subchapter T to read 
as follows: 
Subchapter T: Automated Employment Decision Tools 
§ 5-300. Definitions. 
As used in this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings: 
 
Automated Employment Decision Tool. “Automated employment decision tool” or “AEDT” means 
“Automated employment decision tool” as defined by § 20-870 of the Code where the phrase “to

Here's how they connect:

1. **Definition**: An AEDT is typically defined as any software or algorithm that assists in making employment decisions, such as hiring, promotions, or terminations. This can include tools that analyze resumes, assess candidate skills, or predict job performance.

2. **Requirements**: The requirements for using an AEDT often stem from legal and ethical considerations. These may include:

   - **Transparency**: Employers may be required to disclose the use of AEDTs to candidates and provide information about how the tool works.
   - **Fairness**: There may be requirements to ensure that the tool does not discriminate against protected classes, adhering to equal employment opportunity laws.
   - **Validation**: Employers might need to validate that the AEDT is effective and does not produce biased outcomes, ensuring that it accurately predicts job performance without unfairly disadvantaging certain groups.
   - **Data Privacy**: Compliance with data protection regulations may be necessary, ensuring that candidate data is handled securely and ethically.

3. **Interconnection**: The definition sets the stage for what constitutes an AEDT, while the requirements outline the responsibilities and obligations of employers using these tools. Essentially, the definition informs the scope of what is regulated, and the requirements provide the framework for responsible and lawful use.

In summary, the definition of an AEDT establishes what tools fall under this category, while the requirements dictate how these tools should be implemented to ensure fairness, transparency, and compliance with legal standards.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed explanation of the relationship between the definition and requirements of an automated employment decision tool, but it does not accurately reflect the specific legal requirement of undergoing a bias audit within the past year, which is a key aspect of the ground truth.",0.7083333333333334,0.9945070743560792,4.0,"The generated answer correctly addresses the relationship between the definition and requirements of an automated employment decision tool, covering all components with minimal errors, but lacks specific mention of the bias audit requirement mentioned in the reference answer."
"What is the relationship between test data and the requirements for a bias audit, and how do they differ?","Test data refers to the data used specifically for conducting a bias audit, which is not historical data. On the other hand, the requirements for a bias audit include calculating the selection rate and impact ratio for various categories, such as sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectional categories. While test data is a subset of the data used in a bias audit, the requirements for a bias audit involve specific calculations and analysis of different categories to identify and address biases.","Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and,

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'compare', 'seed_document_id': 18, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': [{'question': 'What is the definition of test data?', 'answer': 'Test data means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.'}, {'question': 'What are the requirements for a bias audit?', 'answer': 'A bias audit must calculate the selection rate and impact ratio for each category, including sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories.'}], 'fake_fact': None}","The relationship between test data and the requirements for a bias audit is crucial in ensuring that algorithms and models operate fairly and without discrimination. However, they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics.

### Relationship:

1. **Purpose**: Both test data and bias audit requirements aim to evaluate the performance and fairness of algorithms. Test data is used to assess how well a model performs, while bias audit requirements focus on identifying and mitigating biases in the model's predictions.

2. **Data Utilization**: Test data can be part of the bias audit process. It is used to evaluate the model's performance across different demographic groups to identify any disparities in outcomes. 

3. **Evaluation Metrics**: Both involve metrics for assessment. Test data might focus on accuracy, precision, and recall, while bias audits will look at fairness metrics, such as disparate impact or equal opportunity.

### Differences:

1. **Focus**:
   - **Test Data**: Primarily concerned with the overall performance of the model. It assesses how well the model predicts outcomes based on the input data.
   - **Bias Audit Requirements**: Specifically focused on identifying and addressing biases in the model's predictions. It examines whether certain groups are unfairly treated or if the model perpetuates existing inequalities.

2. **Composition**:
   - **Test Data**: Typically includes a representative sample of the population the model will serve, ensuring that it covers various scenarios and conditions.
   - **Bias Audit Requirements**: May require specific subsets of data that highlight potential biases, such as data stratified by race, gender, or other protected characteristics.

3. **Outcome**:
   - **Test Data**: The outcome is usually a performance score or metric that indicates how well the model functions.
   - **Bias Audit Requirements**: The outcome is an assessment of fairness, often leading to recommendations for adjustments or improvements to mitigate identified biases.

4. **Process**:
   - **Test Data**: The process involves standard validation techniques, such as cross-validation or holdout testing.
   - **Bias Audit Requirements**: The process may involve more specialized techniques, such as fairness testing frameworks, audits, and stakeholder consultations to ensure comprehensive evaluation.

### Conclusion:

In summary, while test data and bias audit requirements are interconnected in the context of evaluating algorithms, they differ significantly in their focus, composition, and outcomes. Test data assesses overall model performance, while bias audits specifically target fairness and equity in model predictions. Both are essential for developing responsible and ethical AI systems.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed explanation of the relationship and differences between test data and bias audit requirements, but it does not accurately reflect the ground truth.

"What are the differences and similarities between 'selection rate' and 'scoring rate', and how do they relate to each other?","'Selection rate' refers to the rate at which individuals are selected or classified in a hiring process or by an AEDT, while 'scoring rate' pertains to the rate at which individuals receive a score above the sample's median score, calculated by an AEDT. Both rates involve evaluating individuals based on certain criteria, but 'selection rate' focuses on advancement in a process, while 'scoring rate' focuses on achieving a score above a threshold. In some cases, the two rates may be related, such as when a higher 'scoring rate' leads to a higher 'selection rate' for certain categories of individuals.","Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above

employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output

Here’s a breakdown of their differences, similarities, and how they relate to each other:

### Definitions

- **Selection Rate**: This typically refers to the percentage of candidates or items that are chosen from a larger pool. In recruitment, for example, it might be the ratio of candidates who are offered a job compared to the total number of applicants. It can also apply to any scenario where a subset is selected from a larger group.

- **Scoring Rate**: This usually refers to the percentage of points or scores achieved relative to the total possible points in an assessment or evaluation. For instance, in a test, it could be the percentage of correct answers out of the total questions.

### Differences

1. **Context**:
   - Selection Rate is often used in recruitment and selection processes.
   - Scoring Rate is more commonly used in educational assessments, tests, or performance evaluations.

2. **Focus**:
   - Selection Rate focuses on the outcome of a selection process (who gets chosen).
   - Scoring Rate focuses on performance metrics (how well someone performed).

3. **Calculation**:
   - Selection Rate = (Number of selected candidates / Total number of candidates) × 100
   - Scoring Rate = (Total score achieved / Total possible score) × 100

### Similarities

1. **Percentage Representation**: Both rates are expressed as percentages, making it easy to compare performance or outcomes across different contexts.

2. **Evaluation Metrics**: Both serve as metrics to evaluate effectiveness—Selection Rate evaluates the effectiveness of a selection process, while Scoring Rate evaluates the effectiveness of performance.

3. **Influence on Decision-Making**: Both rates can influence decisions. A low selection rate might prompt a review of recruitment strategies, while a low scoring rate might lead to changes in teaching methods or assessment formats.

### Relationship

- **Interconnectedness**: In some contexts, the two can be related. For example, in a recruitment scenario where candidates are scored based on their performance in assessments, the scoring rate can influence the selection rate. Higher scoring rates among candidates may lead to a higher selection rate if the selection criteria are based on scores.

- **Performance Indicators**: Both can serve as indicators of overall effectiveness in their respective areas. For instance, a high selection rate with low scoring rates might indicate that the selection criteria are not stringent enough, while a high scoring rate with a low selection rate might suggest that the assessment is too difficult or that the selection criteria are too strict.

In summary, while Selection Rate and Scoring Rate serve different purposes and are used in different contexts, they both provide valuable insights into processes and performance, and they can influence each other in certain scenarios.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed explanation of selection rate and scoring rate, but it does not accurately reflect the specific definitions and context provided in the ground truth.

What calculations are required in the bias audit and when can an independent auditor exclude a category from these calculations?,"In the bias audit, calculations include determining the impact ratio for each category and assessing the impact of the AEDT on various demographic categories. An independent auditor can exclude a category from the calculations if it represents less than 2% of the data being used for the audit.","Document 16: (d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Here are some common calculations and considerations involved in a bias audit:

### Key Calculations in a Bias Audit:

1. **Disparity Metrics**:
   - **False Positive Rate**: The rate at which individuals from a particular group are incorrectly classified as positive.
   - **False Negative Rate**: The rate at which individuals from a particular group are incorrectly classified as negative.
   - **True Positive Rate**: The proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified.
   - **True Negative Rate**: The proportion of actual negatives that are correctly identified.

2. **Statistical Parity**:
   - Comparing the positive prediction rates across different demographic groups to ensure they are similar.

3. **Equal Opportunity**:
   - Ensuring that the true positive rates are equal across groups.

4. **Calibration**:
   - Checking if predicted probabilities correspond to actual outcomes across different groups.

5. **Impact Ratio**:
   - The ratio of outcomes for different demographic groups to assess the impact of the decision-making process.

6. **Group Fairness Metrics**:
   - Metrics like demographic parity, equalized odds, and disparate impact.

7. **Variance and Standard Deviation**:
   - Analyzing the variance in outcomes across different groups to identify inconsistencies.

### When an Independent Auditor Can Exclude a Category:

An independent auditor may exclude a category from bias audit calculations under certain conditions:

1. **Insufficient Data**:
   - If a category has too few instances to provide statistically significant results, it may be excluded to avoid misleading conclusions.

2. **Irrelevance**:
   - If a category is deemed irrelevant to the analysis or does not impact the outcome being audited, it may be excluded.

3. **Legal or Ethical Considerations**:
   - Certain categories may be protected under laws or ethical guidelines (e.g., race, gender) and may require special handling or exclusion to avoid discrimination.

4. **Data Quality Issues**:
   - If the data for a particular category is found to be unreliable or biased, it may be excluded to maintain the integrity of the audit.

5. **Homogeneity**:
   - If a category consists of a homogeneous group that does not exhibit variance in outcomes, it may be excluded from detailed analysis.

6. **Stakeholder Agreement**:
   - If stakeholders agree that a category should not be included based on specific criteria or context, it may be excluded.

### Conclusion

The goal of a bias audit is to ensure fairness and transparency in decision-making processes. The calculations involved help identify disparities and biases, while the decision to exclude certain categories should be made carefully, considering the implications for fairness and the overall integrity of the audit.",False,"The agent's answer provides a comprehensive overview of bias audit calculations but does not mention the specific criteria of excluding a category if it represents less than 2% of the data, which is a key detail in the ground truth.",0.1875,0.8017358779907227,3.0,"The generated answer provides a comprehensive overview of calculations involved in a bias audit and mentions conditions for excluding categories, but it lacks the specific detail about the 2% threshold mentioned in the reference answer."
What is the relationship between the definition of test data and when an employer or employment agency can rely on a bias audit that uses test data?,"Test data is data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. An employer or employment agency can rely on a bias audit that uses test data if there is insufficient historical data available to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. In other words, test data serves as an alternative when historical data is lacking, allowing employers and employment agencies to still assess and address bias in their processes.","Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency

to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'compare', 'seed_document_id': 18, 'topic': 'Definitions', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': [{'question': 'What is the definition of test data?', 'answer': 'Test data is data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.'}, {'question': 'When can an employer or employment agency rely on a bias audit that uses test data?', 'answer': 'An employer or employment agency can rely on a bias audit that uses test data if there is insufficient historical data available to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.'}], 'fake_fact': None}","The relationship between the definition of test data and the reliance on a bias audit by an employer or employment agency hinges on the quality, relevance, and appropriateness of the test data used in the audit.

### Definition of Test Data
Test data refers to the information and metrics collected during the evaluation of a system, process, or model, particularly in the context of assessing fairness and bias in hiring practices. This data can include:

- **Demographic Information**: Age, gender, race, etc.
- **Performance Metrics**: Scores from assessments, interview ratings, etc.
- **Historical Hiring Data**: Previous hiring decisions and outcomes.

### When Employers Can Rely on a Bias Audit
Employers or employment agencies can rely on a bias audit that uses test data under certain conditions:

1. **Relevance**: The test data must be relevant to the specific hiring practices being audited. If the data does not accurately reflect the candidate pool or the job requirements, the audit's findings may not be applicable.

2. **Quality**: The test data should be of high quality, meaning it is accurate, complete, and collected in a consistent manner. Poor quality data can lead to misleading conclusions about bias.

3. **Statistical Validity**: The methods used to analyze the test data should be statistically sound. This includes using appropriate models and techniques to assess bias and fairness.

4. **Transparency**: The methodology of the bias audit should be transparent, allowing employers to understand how the test data was used and what conclusions were drawn.

5. **Compliance with Legal Standards**: Employers must ensure that the use of test data and the findings from the bias audit comply with relevant laws and regulations regarding employment practices and anti-discrimination.

6. **Contextual Understanding**: Employers should consider the broader context in which the test data was collected and the specific characteristics of their workforce and hiring practices.

### Conclusion
In summary, the relationship between test data and the reliance on a bias audit is critical. Employers must ensure that the test data is relevant, high-quality, statistically valid, transparent, compliant with legal standards, and contextualized to make informed decisions based on the audit's findings. This careful consideration helps mitigate the risk of perpetuating bias in hiring practices.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed explanation of test data and its relevance to bias audits but does not accurately capture the specific relationship described in the ground truth.

"What is the relationship between the calculations in a bias audit of an AEDT and the requirements for the published results, and how do they differ?","In a bias audit of an AEDT, calculations are performed to determine the selection rates for each race/ethnicity and sex category, which are then compared to calculate an impact ratio. On the other hand, the requirements for the published results of a bias audit involve providing notices to employees and candidates for employment, as well as clarifying other obligations for the employer or employment agency. While the calculations focus on analyzing the impact of bias, the requirements for publishing the results are concerned with ensuring transparency and compliance with legal obligations.","Document 14: Data 
on those individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
(c) Where an AEDT scores candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion, a bias 
audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the median score for the full sample of applicants;  
(2) Calculate the scoring rate for individuals in each category;

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;",[],"{'question_type': 'compare', 'seed_document_id': 14, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': [{'question': 'What must be calculated in a bias audit of an AEDT?', 'answer': 'A bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category and compare the selection rates to determine an impact ratio.'}, {'question': 'What are the requirements for the published results of a bias audit?', 'answer': 'The requirements for the published results of a bias audit include providing notices to employees and candidates for employment and clarifying other obligations for the employer or employment agency.'}], 'fake_fact': None}","The relationship between the calculations in a bias audit of an Automated Decision-Making Tool (AEDT) and the requirements for published results is crucial for ensuring transparency, accountability, and fairness in the use of such systems. Here’s a breakdown of how they relate and differ:

### Relationship

1. **Purpose**: Both the calculations in a bias audit and the published results aim to assess and communicate the fairness and accuracy of the AEDT. The audit provides a detailed analysis of potential biases, while the published results summarize these findings for stakeholders.

2. **Data Utilization**: The calculations in a bias audit rely on raw data and specific methodologies to identify biases, such as disparate impact or unequal treatment across different demographic groups. The published results distill these findings into more accessible formats, often highlighting key metrics or conclusions.

3. **Transparency**: Both processes emphasize the need for transparency. The audit calculations should be clear and reproducible, while the published results should present these findings in a way that stakeholders can understand and evaluate.

### Differences

1. **Detail vs. Summary**: The calculations in a bias audit are typically detailed and technical, involving statistical analyses, algorithms, and methodologies. In contrast, the published results are often summarized and may omit some of the technical details to focus on key findings and implications.

2. **Audience**: The audience for the bias audit calculations may include data scientists, statisticians, and technical experts who can interpret complex analyses. The published results, however, are aimed at a broader audience, including policymakers, stakeholders, and the general public, who may not have the same level of technical expertise.

3. **Regulatory Requirements**: The requirements for published results may be dictated by regulatory frameworks or organizational policies that mandate specific disclosures, formats, or metrics. The calculations in a bias audit, while also potentially subject to guidelines, may not have the same level of standardization or requirement for public dissemination.

4. **Focus Areas**: The bias audit calculations may explore a wide range of metrics and dimensions of bias, while the published results may focus on a few key indicators that are deemed most relevant or impactful for decision-making.

### Conclusion

In summary, while the calculations in a bias audit and the published results are interconnected in their goal of assessing and communicating the fairness of an AEDT, they differ in terms of detail, audience, regulatory requirements, and focus. Understanding both aspects is essential for ensuring that AEDTs are used responsibly and equitably.",False,"The agent's answer provides a general overview of the relationship and differences between bias audit calculations and published results but does not specifically address the details of selection rates, impact ratios, or the legal obligations related to published results as outlined in the ground truth.",0.5517241379310345,0.9917283654212952,4.0,"The generated answer correctly addresses the relationship and differences between the calculations in a bias audit of an AEDT and the requirements for published results, providing detailed and relevant information, though it could be slightly more concise."

### Bias Audit Calculations
A bias audit involves analyzing data and outcomes to identify any disparities or biases that may exist across different demographic groups. This can include:

1. **Data Collection**: Gathering data on various categories (e.g., race, gender, age).
2. **Statistical Analysis**: Performing calculations to assess the performance of a model across these categories, such as calculating false positive rates, false negative rates, or other relevant metrics.
3. **Comparative Analysis**: Comparing outcomes between different groups to identify any significant differences that may indicate bias.

### Exclusion of Categories from Impact Ratio
The impact ratio is a measure that evaluates the effect of a model or system on different groups. Excluding certain categories from this ratio can occur for several reasons:

1. **Data Sparsity**: If a category has insufficient data, including it may skew the results or lead to unreliable conclusions.
2. **Irrelevance**: Some categories may not be relevant to the specific analysis being conducted, and their inclusion could dilute the focus on more pertinent groups.
3. **Focus on Specific Biases**: Sometimes, the goal is to assess bias in specific groups, and excluding others helps to clarify the analysis.

### Relationship Between the Two
1. **Impact on Findings**: The exclusion of certain categories from the impact ratio can affect the overall findings of the bias audit. If key demographic groups are excluded, the audit may not fully capture the extent of bias present in the system.
  
2. **Bias Identification**: Calculations in a bias audit are designed to identify disparities. If certain categories are excluded from the impact ratio, it may lead to an incomplete understanding of how bias manifests across the entire population.

3. **Methodological Rigor**: Both processes require careful consideration of which categories to include or exclude. The decisions made in the bias audit calculations should align with the rationale for excluding categories from the impact ratio to ensure that the analysis is both comprehensive and relevant.

In summary, the calculations for a bias audit and the exclusion of categories from the impact ratio are interconnected. Decisions made in one area can significantly influence the outcomes and interpretations in the other, highlighting the importance of a thoughtful and systematic approach to both processes.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed explanation of the relationship between bias audits and impact ratios but does not accurately reflect the specific criteria for excluding categories based on data representation, which is a key aspect of the ground truth.",0.9230769230769232,0.0,3.0,The generated answer provides a detailed explanation of the bias audit and the exclusion of categories but does not directly address the specific relationship between the calculations required for the bias audit and the exclusion of categories from the impact ratio as outlined in the reference answer.

These tools can include algorithms, artificial intelligence, and machine learning systems that analyze data to predict candidate suitability or performance. The relationship between AEDTs and the requirements for using them is crucial, as it impacts both the fairness and legality of employment decisions.

### Key Relationships and Requirements:

1. **Legal Compliance**:
   - **Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Laws**: Employers must ensure that AEDTs comply with EEO laws, which prohibit discrimination based on race, gender, age, disability, and other protected characteristics. This means that the algorithms must be designed to avoid bias and ensure equal opportunity.
   - **Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)**: If an AEDT is used to conduct background checks, employers must comply with FCRA requirements, including obtaining consent from candidates and providing them with adverse action notices if they are not hired based on the tool's findings.

2. **Transparency and Explainability**:
   - Employers are increasingly required to be transparent about how AEDTs work, including the data used and the criteria for decision-making. This transparency helps candidates understand how decisions are made and allows for accountability.
   - Explainability is crucial for ensuring that candidates can challenge or understand decisions made by automated systems, which can help mitigate potential biases.

3. **Validation and Testing**:
   - Employers must validate AEDTs to ensure they are effective and do not disproportionately disadvantage any group. This involves testing the tool on diverse candidate pools and analyzing outcomes to identify any biases.
   - Regular audits and updates to the algorithms are necessary to maintain fairness and accuracy over time.

4. **Data Privacy and Security**:
   - The use of AEDTs involves handling sensitive personal data, which raises concerns about privacy and data security. Employers must comply with data protection regulations (like GDPR or CCPA) and ensure that candidate data is stored and processed securely.

### Impact on Employment Decisions:

1. **Efficiency and Scalability**:
   - AEDTs can streamline the hiring process, allowing employers to process large volumes of applications quickly. This can lead to faster hiring decisions but may also risk overlooking qualified candidates if the tool is not well-designed.

2. **Bias and Discrimination**:
   - If not properly managed, AEDTs can perpetuate or even exacerbate existing biases in hiring. For example, if historical data used to train the algorithms reflects biased hiring practices, the tool may replicate those biases in its recommendations.

3. **Candidate Experience**:
   - The use of AEDTs can impact the candidate experience, either positively or negatively. A transparent and fair process can enhance the candidate's perception of the employer, while a lack of clarity or perceived unfairness can lead to dissatisfaction and damage the employer's brand.

4. **Legal Risks**:
   - Employers face legal risks if AEDTs are found to violate anti-discrimination laws or if they fail to meet the necessary compliance requirements. This can lead to lawsuits, fines, and reputational damage.

In summary, the relationship between automated employment decision tools and their requirements is complex and multifaceted. Properly implemented, AEDTs can enhance efficiency and fairness in hiring. However, without careful attention to legal compliance, transparency, and bias mitigation, they can lead to significant negative consequences for both employers and candidates.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed explanation of automated employment decision tools and their implications, but it does not directly address the specific requirements for using them, such as conducting a bias audit and making results publicly available, which are key points in the ground truth.",0.9285714285714286,0.7661412358283997,5.0,"The generated answer comprehensively addresses the user query, accurately detailing the relationship between automated employment decision tools and their requirements while discussing their impact on employment decisions without any factual errors."

### Requirements under § 20-871(b)(1) and (2):

1. **Disclosure of Use**: Employers must inform candidates that an AEDT is being used in the hiring process. This includes providing details about how the tool works and its purpose.

2. **Data Transparency**: Employers must disclose the criteria and data used by the AEDT to make decisions. This includes information on how the tool evaluates candidates and the factors that influence its decisions.

### Comparison with Publicly Available Information:

Before the use of an AEDT, employers must also make certain information publicly available, which typically includes:

1. **General Information about the AEDT**: This includes the name of the tool, its purpose, and a general description of how it functions.

2. **Performance Metrics**: Employers may need to provide data on the effectiveness of the AEDT, including any validation studies or assessments that demonstrate its reliability and fairness.

3. **Impact Assessments**: Information on how the AEDT impacts different demographic groups may be required to ensure compliance with anti-discrimination laws.

4. **Contact Information**: Employers should provide a point of contact for candidates who have questions or concerns about the AEDT.

### Summary:

Here’s a breakdown of their definitions, differences, similarities, and how they relate to each other:

### Definitions

**Scoring Rate:**
- **Definition:** In sports, the scoring rate typically refers to the number of points or goals scored by a player or team over a specific period of time (e.g., points per game, goals per match). In data analysis, it can refer to the rate at which a certain outcome is achieved.
  
**Screen:**
- **Definition:** In a general context, ""screen"" can refer to a method of filtering or evaluating something. In sports, it often refers to a play where a player blocks a defender to free up a teammate for a shot or pass. In data analysis, it can mean the process of filtering data to identify relevant information.

### Differences

1. **Context of Use:**
   - **Scoring Rate** is primarily used in sports and performance metrics, focusing on output or results.
   - **Screen** is more versatile, applicable in both sports (as a tactic) and data analysis (as a filtering method).

2. **Nature of Measurement:**
   - **Scoring Rate** is quantitative, measuring performance in terms of points or goals.
   - **Screen** is qualitative or procedural, focusing on the method of achieving a goal or filtering data.

3. **Purpose:**
   - **Scoring Rate** aims to evaluate effectiveness or efficiency in scoring.
   - **Screen** aims to facilitate decision-making or improve outcomes by filtering or blocking.

### Similarities

1. **Goal-Oriented:**
   - Both concepts are aimed at achieving a specific outcome—whether it’s scoring points in a game or identifying relevant data.

2. **Performance Evaluation:**
   - Both can be used to assess performance, either of a player/team (through scoring rate) or the effectiveness of a method (through screening).

3. **Strategic Importance:**
   - In sports, both scoring and screening are strategic elements that can influence the outcome of a game.

### Relationship

- **Interconnectedness in Sports:** In basketball, for example, a player with a high scoring rate may benefit from effective screens set by teammates. The screen creates opportunities for scoring, thus influencing the scoring rate.
  
- **Data Analysis:** In data contexts, screening can help identify high-scoring segments or trends, thereby indirectly affecting the scoring rate by focusing on the most relevant data points.

In summary, while ""Scoring Rate"" and ""Screen"" serve different functions and are used in different contexts, they share a common goal of enhancing performance and achieving desired outcomes. Their relationship is particularly evident in sports, where effective screening can lead to improved scoring rates.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed explanation of 'Scoring Rate' and 'Screen' but does not align with the ground truth definitions.

1. **Definition**: The definition of AEDT usually outlines what constitutes such a tool, including its functionalities, the types of data it processes, and its role in decision-making. This definition is crucial for establishing what falls under the regulations.

2. **Regulatory Requirements**: Many cities have implemented laws or guidelines that govern the use of AEDTs. These requirements may include:
   - **Transparency**: Employers may be required to disclose the use of AEDTs to candidates and provide information about how the tool works.
   - **Bias Mitigation**: There may be mandates to assess and mitigate any potential biases in the algorithms to ensure fair treatment of all candidates.
   - **Validation**: Employers might need to validate the effectiveness and fairness of the AEDT before using it in decision-making processes.
   - **Data Privacy**: Regulations may also address how data is collected, stored, and used, ensuring compliance with privacy laws.

3. **Enforcement and Accountability**: The relationship also includes mechanisms for enforcement, where employers may face penalties for non-compliance with the established requirements.

### Definition of 'Employment Decision'
An 'employment decision' typically refers to any choice made by an employer regarding an individual's employment status, which can include hiring, promotion, demotion, termination, and other related actions. This definition encompasses a wide range of decisions that affect an employee's career trajectory and workplace experience.

### Requirements for Using Automated Employment Decision Tools
When it comes to using AEDTs, there are specific requirements that often stem from legal and ethical considerations. These requirements may include:

1. **Transparency**: Employers must disclose the use of AEDTs to candidates and provide information about how these tools function.
  
2. **Fairness and Non-Discrimination**: AEDTs must be designed to avoid bias and discrimination against protected classes. This is particularly important given that employment decisions can significantly impact individuals' lives.

3. **Validation and Testing**: Employers may be required to validate the effectiveness of the AEDT in predicting job performance and ensure that it does not disproportionately disadvantage any group.

4. **Data Privacy**: Compliance with data protection laws is essential, ensuring that candidates' personal information is handled appropriately.

5. **Accountability**: Employers may need to establish accountability measures to address any adverse outcomes resulting from the use of AEDTs.

### Relationship Between the Two
The relationship lies in the fact that the definition of 'employment decision' sets the context for the application of AEDTs. Since AEDTs are used to make employment decisions, the requirements for their use are designed to ensure that these decisions are made fairly, transparently, and without bias. 

In essence, the definition of 'employment decision' informs the scope of what is affected by AEDTs, while the requirements for using these tools aim to safeguard the integrity of those decisions. This relationship underscores the importance of ethical considerations in the automation of hiring processes, ensuring that technology enhances rather than undermines fair employment practices.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed explanation of the relationship between 'employment decision' and automated employment decision tools, but it does not accurately reflect the specific legal requirement mentioned in the ground truth regarding the necessity of a bias audit conducted within the last year. The agent's response lacks this critical detail.",0.3793103448275862,0.9078392386436462,4.0,"The generated answer provides a comprehensive explanation of both the definition of 'employment decision' and the requirements for using automated employment decision tools, addressing all components of the query with only minor deviations from the reference answer."
What is the relationship between the requirements for a bias audit and the concept of test data?,"The requirements for a bias audit involve calculating selection rates for different demographic categories to determine an impact ratio. Test data, on the other hand, refers to the data used in a bias audit that is not historical data. Test data is necessary to conduct a bias audit and apply the requirements. In summary, the requirements for a bias audit rely on analyzing selection rates, while test data is the specific type of data used to perform the audit.","Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Document 6: 2 
 
 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.",[],"{'question_type': 'compare', 'seed_document_id': 5, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': [{'question': 'What are the requirements for a bias audit?', 'answer': 'A bias audit must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category and compare the selection rates to determine an impact ratio.'}, {'question': 'What is test data in the context of a bias audit?', 'answer': 'Test data is data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.'}], 'fake_fact': None}","The relationship between the requirements for a bias audit and the concept of test data is crucial in ensuring that algorithms and models are fair and unbiased. Here’s how they interconnect:

### 1. **Definition of Bias Audit:**
A bias audit is a systematic evaluation of algorithms or models to identify and mitigate biases that may lead to unfair treatment of individuals or groups. This process involves examining the data, the model's decisions, and the outcomes to ensure that they do not disproportionately disadvantage any particular demographic.

### 2. **Role of Test Data:**
Test data refers to a subset of data used to evaluate the performance of a model. It is crucial for assessing how well the model generalizes to unseen data and for identifying any biases in its predictions. 

### 3. **Requirements for a Bias Audit:**
- **Diverse Representation:** The test data must include a diverse representation of different demographic groups to ensure that the model's performance is evaluated across various segments of the population.
- **Balanced Samples:** The test data should be balanced to avoid skewed results that could mask biases. For instance, if a model is tested predominantly on one demographic, it may appear to perform well while failing for others.
- **Real-World Scenarios:** The test data should reflect real-world scenarios to accurately assess how the model will perform in practice, including edge cases that may reveal biases.
- **Transparency and Documentation:** The sources and characteristics of the test data should be documented to understand potential biases in the data itself.

### 4. **Interconnection:**
- **Identifying Biases:** The test data is essential for identifying biases during a bias audit. By analyzing how the model performs on different groups within the test data, auditors can pinpoint areas where the model may be biased.
- **Evaluating Impact:** The results from the bias audit, informed by the test data, can help stakeholders understand the impact of biases on different populations and guide necessary adjustments to the model or data.
- **Iterative Improvement:** The findings from a bias audit can lead to the refinement of test data, ensuring that future audits are more effective in identifying and mitigating biases.

### Conclusion:
In summary, the requirements for a bias audit heavily rely on the quality and composition of test data. Properly constructed test data is essential for accurately assessing biases, ensuring fairness, and ultimately improving the model's performance across diverse populations.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed explanation of the relationship between bias audits and test data but does not accurately reflect the specific requirements mentioned in the ground truth, such as calculating selection rates and the distinction between historical data and test data.",0.6666666666666666,1.0,4.0,"The generated answer provides a comprehensive explanation of the relationship between bias audits and test data, covering all relevant components with only minor deviations from the reference answer."

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.

audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.",[],"{'question_type': 'compare', 'seed_document_id': 17, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': [{'question': 'What is the purpose of a bias audit?', 'answer': 'The purpose of a bias audit is to calculate the impact ratio for each category and ensure that the AEDT does not have a discriminatory impact on sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectional categories.'}, {'question': 'When can an employer rely on a bias audit that uses test data?', 'answer': 'An employer can rely on a bias audit that uses test data when there is insufficient historical data available to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.'}], 'fake_fact': None}","The relationship between the purpose of a bias audit and when an employer can rely on a bias audit that uses test data is centered around ensuring fairness and compliance in employment practices.

### Purpose of a Bias Audit:
1. **Identify Disparities**: A bias audit aims to identify and assess any potential biases in hiring, promotion, or other employment practices. This includes examining how different demographic groups are affected by these practices.
  
2. **Enhance Fairness**: The ultimate goal is to enhance fairness and equity in the workplace, ensuring that all candidates are evaluated based on their qualifications rather than irrelevant factors.

3. **Compliance and Risk Management**: Bias audits help employers comply with legal standards and mitigate risks associated with discrimination claims.

### When Employers Can Rely on a Bias Audit Using Test Data:
1. **Validity of Test Data**: Employers can rely on a bias audit if the test data used is valid and representative of the population being assessed. This means the data should accurately reflect the skills and qualifications relevant to the job.

2. **Transparency and Methodology**: The methodology used in the audit should be transparent and scientifically sound. Employers need to ensure that the audit process is rigorous and follows best practices in data analysis.

3. **Actionable Insights**: Employers can rely on the audit when it provides actionable insights that can lead to improvements in hiring practices. This includes recommendations for reducing bias and enhancing diversity.

4. **Regular Updates**: Employers should regularly update their bias audits to reflect changes in the workforce, job requirements, and societal norms. Relying on outdated data can lead to ineffective or misleading conclusions.

5. **Legal and Ethical Standards**: The audit must align with legal and ethical standards. Employers should ensure that the audit process does not inadvertently reinforce existing biases or create new ones.

In summary, the relationship between the purpose of a bias audit and its reliance on test data hinges on the audit's ability to provide valid, transparent, and actionable insights that promote fairness and compliance in employment practices.",False,"The agent's answer provides a general overview of bias audits but does not accurately address the specific relationship between the purpose of a bias audit and when an employer can rely on test data, as outlined in the ground truth.",0.2368421052631578,0.0,4.0,"The generated answer covers the components of the user query well and provides relevant information, but it lacks a direct mention of the impact ratio and the specific context in which test data can be used, which are key elements in the reference answer."

### Relationship Between AEDT and Bias Audit

The relationship between the two concepts lies in the need for accountability and fairness in automated employment decisions. Since AEDTs can inadvertently perpetuate or exacerbate biases present in the data they are trained on, conducting a bias audit is crucial. The audit serves as a mechanism to ensure that these tools operate fairly and do not discriminate against any group, thereby promoting equitable employment practices.

   - Employers may be required to disclose the use of AEDTs to candidates.
   - Clear explanations of how the tools work and the criteria they use for decision-making may be mandated.

2. **Fairness and Non-Discrimination**:
   - AEDTs must comply with anti-discrimination laws, ensuring that they do not disproportionately disadvantage any protected groups.
   - Employers may need to conduct impact assessments to evaluate the fairness of the tools.

3. **Data Privacy**:
   - Compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) is essential, particularly regarding the collection and processing of personal data.
   - Candidates may have rights regarding their data, including access and deletion.

4. **Validation and Testing**:
   - Employers may be required to validate the effectiveness and reliability of the AEDTs to ensure they are job-related and consistent with business necessity.

5. **Recordkeeping**:
   - Maintaining records of the use of AEDTs, including the data used and the outcomes, may be necessary for compliance and auditing purposes.

### Penalties

1. **Legal Consequences**:
   - Violations of anti-discrimination laws can lead to lawsuits, fines, and other legal actions.
   - Non-compliance with data protection regulations can result in significant fines and penalties.

2. **Reputational Damage**:
   - Negative publicity from discriminatory practices or data breaches can harm an organization’s reputation, affecting its ability to attract talent and customers.

3. **Regulatory Scrutiny**:
   - Increased scrutiny from regulatory bodies can lead to audits and investigations, which may result in further penalties or required changes in practices.

4. **Loss of Business Opportunities**:
   - Companies found to be using biased or non-compliant AEDTs may lose contracts or partnerships, particularly with organizations that prioritize diversity and inclusion.

5. **Remedial Actions**:
   - Organizations may be required to take corrective actions, such as revising their hiring processes or providing training to staff on the ethical use of technology.

### Requirements for Providing Information:

1. **Transparency**: Employers should clearly disclose the use of AEDTs in their hiring processes. This includes explaining what an AEDT is and how it will be used in evaluating candidates.

2. **Data Privacy**: Employers must comply with data protection laws, ensuring that candidates' personal information is handled securely and transparently.

3. **Fairness and Non-Discrimination**: Employers should ensure that the use of AEDTs does not lead to discriminatory practices. They may need to provide information on how the tool is designed to promote fairness.

4. **Accessibility**: Information about AEDTs should be easily accessible on the employer's or agency's website, ideally in a dedicated section about hiring practices or candidate rights.

5. **Contact Information**: Employers should provide a way for candidates to ask questions or seek clarification about the AEDT, such as a contact email or phone number.

### How to Notify Candidates:

1. **Website Information**: Create a dedicated page or section on the company’s website that outlines the use of AEDTs, including their purpose, how they work, and any relevant policies.

2. **Job Postings**: Include a brief mention of AEDT usage in job postings, directing candidates to the website for more detailed information.

3. **Candidate Communication**: Send an email or notification to candidates during the application process, informing them about the use of AEDTs and linking to the relevant information on the website.

4. **Pre-Assessment Notifications**: Before candidates undergo any assessments that involve AEDTs, provide them with clear information about what to expect.

5. **Training for HR Staff**: Ensure that HR personnel are trained to explain the use of AEDTs to candidates and answer any questions they may have.

6. **Feedback Mechanism**: Offer candidates a way to provide feedback on their experience with the AEDT, which can help improve transparency and trust.

### Conclusion

Employers and employment agencies should prioritize transparency and fairness when using AEDTs. By providing clear information and maintaining open lines of communication, they can help candidates understand the role of these tools in the hiring process.

Here’s a breakdown of typical requirements and how they compare to notice requirements for candidates:

### Requirements for Employers Regarding AEDT Information:

1. **Disclosure of Use**: Employers must inform candidates if they use AEDT in their hiring processes. This includes specifying what tools are used and how they impact decision-making.

2. **Description of the Tool**: Employers may need to provide a description of the AEDT, including its purpose, how it works, and the criteria it uses to evaluate candidates.

3. **Data Privacy**: Employers should outline how candidate data is collected, used, and protected when using AEDT.

4. **Impact on Candidates**: Information on how the AEDT may affect candidates' chances of being hired should be disclosed, including any potential biases or limitations of the tool.

5. **Right to Appeal**: Some jurisdictions require that candidates be informed of their rights to appeal or contest decisions made by the AEDT.

### Comparison to Notice Requirements for Candidates:

1. **Timing of Notice**: While AEDT disclosures are typically required before or during the application process, notice requirements for candidates often focus on informing them of their rights and the hiring process itself.

2. **Content of Notice**: The notice to candidates may include information about the hiring process, equal opportunity policies, and any specific rights they have under employment laws, which may not be as detailed as the AEDT disclosures.

3. **Format**: AEDT information may need to be prominently displayed on the employer's website or in job postings, while general candidate notice requirements can be less formal and may be included in employee handbooks or during the interview process.

4. **Regulatory Compliance**: Both AEDT disclosures and candidate notice requirements are often influenced by local, state, or federal regulations, which can dictate specific language, timing, and methods of communication.

### Conclusion:

In summary, while both AEDT information and candidate notice requirements aim to promote transparency and fairness in the hiring process, AEDT disclosures tend to be more specific and detailed regarding the tools used in decision-making. Employers must stay informed about the legal requirements in their jurisdiction to ensure compliance with both sets of requirements.",False,"The agent's answer provides a general overview of AEDT requirements but does not mention the specific requirement to make the date of the most recent bias audit and a summary of results publicly available.

Here are the key requirements:

1. **Bias Audit**: Employers must conduct a bias audit of the AEDT at least once every year. This audit should assess whether the tool results in discriminatory outcomes based on protected characteristics such as race, gender, or age.

2. **Disclosure**: Employers are required to notify candidates that an AEDT will be used in the hiring process. This notification must be provided at least 10 days before the tool is used.

3. **Data Transparency**: Employers must provide information about the AEDT, including its purpose and how it works, upon request from candidates.

4. **Record Keeping**: Employers should maintain records of the AEDT's use, including the results of the bias audits and any other relevant documentation.

5. **Compliance with Anti-Discrimination Laws**: The use of the AEDT must comply with all applicable anti-discrimination laws, ensuring that the tool does not disproportionately impact candidates based on protected characteristics.

6. **Candidate Rights**: Candidates should have the right to request an alternative assessment method if they believe the AEDT is unfair or discriminatory.

Employers should ensure they are fully compliant with these requirements to avoid potential legal issues and to promote fair hiring practices.",False,"The agent's answer includes additional requirements and details that are not part of the ground truth, specifically the requirement for the bias audit results to be made publicly available on the employer's website, which is not mentioned in the agent's response.",0.5555555555555556,0.8838293552398682,4.0,"The generated answer correctly addresses the requirements for using an automated employment decision tool in New York City, covering key components such as bias audits and candidate notification, but includes additional details that, while accurate, are not explicitly required by the query."
An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. Can the employer rely on a bias audit conducted using test data?,"No, the employer cannot rely on a bias audit conducted using test data. According to § 5-303, an employer may rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other employers or employment agencies, but not on a bias audit conducted using test data.","Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'rule_conclusion', 'seed_document_id': 11, 'topic': 'Metrics/Data', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","An employer can use a bias audit conducted with test data as part of their evaluation process, but it should not be the sole basis for assessing the fairness and effectiveness of the Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT). Here are some key considerations:

1. **Relevance of Test Data**: The test data used in the audit should be representative of the actual data the AEDT will encounter in real-world applications. If the test data is not reflective of the diverse applicant pool, the findings may not accurately represent potential biases.

2. **Ongoing Monitoring**: Bias audits should be conducted regularly, especially after significant changes to the AEDT or its underlying data. Relying solely on a past audit may overlook new biases that have emerged.

3. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: A bias audit should include multiple methods of evaluation, such as real-world performance data, user feedback, and comparisons against industry benchmarks, in addition to test data.

4. **Transparency and Documentation**: The audit process should be transparent, with clear documentation of methodologies, findings, and any limitations of the test data used.

5. **Legal and Ethical Considerations**: Depending on jurisdiction, there may be legal requirements for bias audits that necessitate a more thorough approach than just using test data.

In summary, while a bias audit using test data can provide valuable insights, it should be part of a broader, ongoing assessment strategy that includes real-world data and other evaluation methods to ensure the AEDT remains fair and effective.",False,"The agent's answer suggests that a bias audit using test data can be part of the evaluation process, which contradicts the ground truth stating that the employer cannot rely on such an audit.",0.25,0.0,1.0,"The generated answer is completely incorrect as it contradicts the reference answer by stating that an employer can use a bias audit conducted with test data, which is explicitly stated as not permissible."

data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency

1. **Test Data Limitations**: Test data often simulates scenarios that may not reflect actual candidate experiences or the nuances of the hiring process. It may not account for factors like interpersonal dynamics, cultural fit, or the subjective nature of interviews.

2. **Historical Data Value**: Historical data provides insights into past hiring decisions, candidate demographics, and outcomes. It can reveal patterns of bias that may not be evident in test scenarios. Analyzing historical data can help identify systemic issues in the hiring process.

3. **Combination Approach**: A more comprehensive bias audit would ideally use both test data and historical data. This combination can help validate findings and provide a more holistic view of potential biases in the hiring process.

4. **Contextual Factors**: The context in which hiring occurs is crucial. Test data may not account for external factors such as economic conditions, industry trends, or changes in societal attitudes toward race and ethnicity.

5. **Legal and Ethical Considerations**: Employers should be aware of legal implications related to discrimination and bias. Relying solely on test data may not provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate compliance with anti-discrimination laws.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers

agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT.

In the U.S., for example, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and various state laws prohibit discrimination based on protected characteristics such as race, gender, and disability. If the excluded category is associated with a protected characteristic, the exclusion could raise concerns about potential discrimination, even if it represents a small percentage of the data.

Additionally, the concept of ""adverse impact"" is important in employment law. If the AEDT disproportionately affects a small group, even if they represent less than 2% of the data, it could still be scrutinized for potential bias.

Employers are generally encouraged to include all relevant data in bias audits to ensure a comprehensive understanding of how their tools may impact different groups. Therefore, while the exclusion of a small category might not be explicitly illegal, it could still be viewed as problematic from a fairness and compliance perspective.

Here are the key requirements:

1. **Bias Audit**: Employers must conduct a bias audit of the AEDT at least once every year. This audit should assess the tool's impact on different demographic groups to ensure it does not disproportionately disadvantage any group based on protected characteristics.

2. **Notice Requirement**: Employers are required to provide candidates with notice that an AEDT will be used in the hiring process. This notice must be given at least 10 days before the tool is used.

3. **Data Transparency**: Employers must disclose information about the AEDT, including its purpose and the criteria it uses to evaluate candidates. This transparency helps candidates understand how their data will be used.

4. **Candidate Rights**: Candidates have the right to request information about the AEDT, including the results of the bias audit and the specific factors that the tool considers in its evaluation.

5. **Compliance with Anti-Discrimination Laws**: Employers must ensure that the use of AEDTs complies with all applicable anti-discrimination laws, ensuring that the tools do not lead to discriminatory practices in hiring.

6. **Record Keeping**: Employers should maintain records related to the use of AEDTs, including the results of audits and any communications with candidates regarding the use of these tools.

These requirements aim to promote fairness and transparency in the hiring process, ensuring that automated tools do not perpetuate bias or discrimination. Employers should stay updated on any changes to the law and ensure compliance to avoid potential penalties.",False,"While the agent's answer provides a detailed overview of the requirements under New York City Local Law 144, it misses key elements from the ground truth, such as the requirement for the results of the bias audit to be publicly available on the employer's website and the specifics about the information that must be provided to candidates regarding job qualifications and characteristics.

"An employer is using an AEDT to screen candidates for a job position. The AEDT assesses candidates based on 'culture fit.' According to the provided context, what are the requirements for conducting a bias audit of the AEDT?","The requirements for conducting a bias audit of the AEDT include calculating the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category, comparing the selection rates to the most selected category to determine an impact ratio, and reporting the results to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) as required by the EEO Component 1 report. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures.","Document 9: 4 
 
iii. 
at any point during the bias audit, has a direct financial interest or a material indirect 
financial interest in an employer or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to 
use the  AEDT or in a vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT. 
 
Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.  
 
 
 
    _________selection rate for a category________  
Impact Ratio =        selection rate of the most selected category  
 
OR 
 
  
 
     ______scoring rate for a category__________  
Impact Ratio =        scoring rate of the highest scoring category 
 
 
Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;",[],"{'question_type': 'rule_conclusion', 'seed_document_id': 9, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","To conduct a bias audit of an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT) that assesses candidates based on 'culture fit,' the following requirements should typically be considered:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather comprehensive data on the candidates who were assessed by the AEDT, including demographic information (e.g., age, gender, race, ethnicity) and the outcomes of the assessments.

2. **Assessment Criteria**: Clearly define what 'culture fit' means within the context of the job position and how it is measured by the AEDT. This includes understanding the algorithms and criteria used in the assessment.

3. **Bias Identification**: Analyze the data to identify any disparities in outcomes based on demographic factors. This involves statistical analysis to determine if certain groups are disproportionately favored or disadvantaged by the AEDT.

4. **Validation of the Tool**: Ensure that the AEDT has been validated for fairness and accuracy. This may involve comparing the AEDT's outcomes with actual job performance and retention rates.

5. **Stakeholder Involvement**: Engage with stakeholders, including HR professionals, legal experts, and representatives from diverse backgrounds, to gain insights and perspectives on potential biases.

6. **Compliance with Regulations**: Ensure that the audit complies with relevant laws and regulations regarding employment practices and anti-discrimination.

7. **Documentation and Reporting**: Document the audit process, findings, and any identified biases. Prepare a report that outlines the methodology, results, and recommendations for addressing any biases found.

8. **Remediation Strategies**: Develop and implement strategies to mitigate any identified biases, which may include revising the AEDT, adjusting the criteria for 'culture fit,' or providing additional training for hiring managers.

9. **Ongoing Monitoring**: Establish a plan for ongoing monitoring and periodic audits of the AEDT to ensure continued fairness and to adapt to any changes in the workforce or job market.

10. **Transparency**: Maintain transparency with candidates and stakeholders about how the AEDT works, the criteria used, and the results of the bias audit.

By following these requirements, employers can better ensure that their AEDT is fair and equitable in its assessment of candidates based on 'culture fit.'",False,"The agent's answer provides a general overview of requirements for conducting a bias audit but does not specifically mention the necessary calculations for selection rates, impact ratios, or reporting to the EEOC, which are critical components outlined in the ground truth.",0.6521739130434783,0.8622497320175171,3.0,"The generated answer provides a comprehensive overview of the requirements for conducting a bias audit of an AEDT, but it lacks specific details about calculating selection rates and reporting to the EEOC, which are critical components mentioned in the reference answer."

§ 20-870 Definitions.
For the purposes of this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings:
   Automated employment decision tool. The term ""automated employment decision tool"" means any computational process, derived from machine
learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence, that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation,
that is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons. The term
""automated employment decision tool"" does not include a tool that does not automate, support, substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-
making processes and that does not materially impact natural persons, including, but not limited to, a junk email filter, firewall, antivirus software,
calculator, spreadsheet, database, data set, or other compilation of data.
   Bias audit. The term ""bias audit"" means an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor. Such bias audit shall include but not be limited to the
testing of an automated employment decision tool to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported
by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of
federal regulations.

An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. Can the employer rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT?,"Yes, the employer can rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other employers or employment agencies.","Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Here are some considerations:

1. **Regulatory Compliance**: Check if there are specific legal requirements for bias audits in your jurisdiction. Some laws may require audits to be conducted by independent third parties or may have specific standards for the data used.

2. **Data Relevance**: The historical data should be representative of the current workforce and hiring practices. If the data is outdated or not reflective of current conditions, it may not provide an accurate assessment of bias.

3. **Methodology**: The audit should follow a robust methodology that can effectively identify and measure bias. This includes using appropriate statistical techniques and ensuring that the analysis accounts for various factors that could influence outcomes.

4. **Transparency and Accountability**: Relying solely on internal audits may raise concerns about transparency. Engaging an independent third party can enhance credibility and trust in the findings.

5. **Continuous Monitoring**: Bias audits should not be a one-time event. Continuous monitoring and regular updates are essential to ensure that the AEDT remains fair and unbiased over time.

In summary, while an employer may use historical data from its own use of the AEDT for a bias audit, it is crucial to ensure that the audit meets regulatory standards, uses relevant and current data, employs a sound methodology, and considers the benefits of external validation.",False,"The agent's answer is overly cautious and suggests multiple considerations, while the ground truth states that the employer can rely on the historical data without additional conditions.

§ 20-870 Definitions.
For the purposes of this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings:
   Automated employment decision tool. The term ""automated employment decision tool"" means any computational process, derived from machine
learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence, that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation,
that is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons. The term
""automated employment decision tool"" does not include a tool that does not automate, support, substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-
making processes and that does not materially impact natural persons, including, but not limited to, a junk email filter, firewall, antivirus software,
calculator, spreadsheet, database, data set, or other compilation of data.
   Bias audit. The term ""bias audit"" means an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor. Such bias audit shall include but not be limited to the
testing of an automated employment decision tool to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported
by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of
federal regulations.

1. **Transparency**: The employer should inform candidates that an automated tool is being used in the hiring process. This includes providing details about how the tool works and what data it uses.

2. **Non-Discrimination**: The tool must comply with anti-discrimination laws. It should not disproportionately disadvantage candidates based on protected characteristics such as race, gender, age, or disability.

3. **Validation**: The employer should validate the tool to ensure that it accurately predicts job performance and does not introduce bias. This may involve conducting studies or analyses to demonstrate the tool's effectiveness and fairness.

4. **Data Privacy**: The employer must adhere to data protection regulations, ensuring that candidates' personal information is handled securely and used only for the intended purpose.

5. **Opportunity for Appeal**: Candidates should have the opportunity to contest or appeal decisions made by the automated tool, allowing for human review if necessary.

6. **Compliance with Local Laws**: The employer must ensure that the use of the tool complies with any specific local laws or regulations governing automated decision-making in employment.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'rule_conclusion', 'seed_document_id': 15, 'topic': 'Metrics/Data', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","To use an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT) for scoring applicants on 'culture fit,' the employer must ensure that the AEDT is compliant with relevant laws and regulations. This includes conducting a thorough validation of the tool to ensure it does not discriminate against any protected groups and that it accurately measures the intended attributes related to culture fit. Additionally, the employer should provide transparency about how the AEDT works and how it impacts the hiring process, as well as offer candidates the opportunity to understand and challenge the decisions made by the tool.",False,"The agent's answer does not mention the requirement for a bias audit conducted no more than a year before using the AEDT, which is a specific condition outlined in the ground truth.",0.0,0.8071474432945251,3.0,"The generated answer addresses some relevant components regarding the use of an AEDT but fails to mention the specific requirement of conducting a bias audit within the specified timeframe, leading to partial correctness."
An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job posting. What are the requirements for a bias audit of the AEDT?,"For an AEDT that selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion, a bias audit must calculate the selection rate and impact ratio for each category, including sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories. The bias audit must also indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT that are not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category.","Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Document 6: 2 
 
 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 


Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.

Here are the key requirements for a bias audit of the AEDT:

1. **Data Collection and Transparency**:
   - Collect data on the inputs and outputs of the AEDT, including demographic information of candidates (if available) and the decisions made by the tool.
   - Ensure transparency in how the AEDT operates, including the algorithms used and the criteria for decision-making.

2. **Bias Identification**:
   - Analyze the data to identify any potential biases in the AEDT's decision-making process. This includes examining whether certain demographic groups are disproportionately screened out or favored.
   - Use statistical methods to assess the impact of the AEDT on different demographic groups.

3. **Validation and Testing**:
   - Conduct validation studies to test the AEDT's effectiveness and fairness. This may involve comparing the AEDT's decisions against human decisions to evaluate consistency and bias.
   - Implement A/B testing to compare outcomes between candidates processed by the AEDT and those processed through traditional methods.

4. **Compliance with Legal Standards**:
   - Ensure that the AEDT complies with relevant employment laws and regulations, such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) guidelines.
   - Document compliance efforts and any adjustments made to the AEDT based on audit findings.

5. **Stakeholder Involvement**:
   - Involve diverse stakeholders in the audit process, including HR professionals, data scientists, and representatives from affected demographic groups, to gain multiple perspectives on potential biases.

6. **Remediation Plans**:
   - Develop and implement plans to address any identified biases. This may include adjusting the algorithms, changing the data inputs, or modifying the decision-making criteria.
   - Monitor the AEDT continuously to ensure that any changes lead to improved fairness and reduced bias.

7. **Documentation and Reporting**:
   - Maintain thorough documentation of the audit process, findings, and any corrective actions taken.
   - Prepare a report summarizing the audit results, methodologies used, and recommendations for ongoing monitoring and improvement.

8. **Ongoing Monitoring**:
   - Establish a framework for ongoing monitoring of the AEDT to ensure that it remains fair and unbiased over time, especially as new data is introduced or as the job market evolves.

By adhering to these requirements, employers can help ensure that their use of AEDTs in hiring processes is fair, transparent, and compliant with legal standards.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed overview of bias audit requirements but does not specifically mention calculating the selection rate and impact ratio for demographic categories, which is a key aspect of the ground truth answer.",0.225,0.901664137840271,3.0,"The generated answer provides a comprehensive overview of bias audit requirements but does not specifically mention calculating selection rates and impact ratios for demographic categories, which is a key component of the reference answer."

New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection 
 
Notice of Adoption of Final Rule 
 
Pursuant to the authority vested in the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection by 
Sections 1043 and 2203(f) of the New York City Charter and Section 20-104(b) of the New York City 
Administrative Code, and in accordance with the requirements of Section 1043 of the New York City Charter, 
the Department amends Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York.  
 
An initial version of this rule was proposed and published on September 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on 
November 4, 2022, and comments regarding the rule were received. DCWP proposed a second version of this 
rule on December 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on January 23, 2023, and comments regarding the rule 
were received.  
 
Statement of Basis and Purpose 
 
The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP” or “Department”) is adding rules to implement 
new legislation regarding automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”). Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits 
employers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has 
been subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly 
available, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   
 
These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.

1. **Compliance with Regulations**: Depending on the jurisdiction, there may be legal requirements to ensure that hiring practices are fair and non-discriminatory. Conducting a bias audit can help ensure compliance with these regulations.

2. **Fairness and Equity**: A bias audit can help identify any potential biases in the AEDT that could disadvantage certain groups of candidates based on race, gender, age, or other protected characteristics.

3. **Transparency and Accountability**: Conducting an audit promotes transparency in the hiring process and demonstrates the employer's commitment to fair hiring practices.

4. **Improving Decision-Making**: Identifying and addressing biases can lead to better hiring decisions and a more diverse and qualified candidate pool.

5. **Reputation Management**: Employers that actively work to mitigate bias in their hiring processes can enhance their reputation as equitable and inclusive workplaces.

Generally, it refers to the reason or intention behind an action, object, or existence. Here are a few perspectives on purpose:

1. **Personal Purpose**: For individuals, purpose often relates to personal goals, values, and what gives life meaning. It can involve career aspirations, relationships, or personal growth.

2. **Philosophical Purpose**: In philosophy, purpose can relate to existential questions about the meaning of life and human existence.

3. **Organizational Purpose**: For businesses or organizations, purpose often refers to their mission or vision—what they aim to achieve and the impact they want to have on society.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and

the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'vague', 'seed_document_id': 15, 'topic': 'Metrics/Data', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","To provide a more accurate response, could you specify the context or type of calculations you're referring to? For example, are you looking for calculations related to:

1. **Finance** (e.g., interest, investment returns)?
2. **Physics** (e.g., force, energy)?
3. **Statistics** (e.g., mean, standard deviation)?

What should be in the summary?,"The summary of results of a bias audit should include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios for all categories.","Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.",[],"{'question_type': 'vague', 'seed_document_id': 6, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","Could you please clarify what specific requirements you're asking about?

These tools can analyze various data points, such as resumes, application forms, assessments, and even social media profiles, to evaluate candidates and predict their suitability for a position.

Key features of automated employment decision tools include:

1. **Data Analysis**: They process large volumes of data quickly, identifying patterns and trends that may not be immediately apparent to human recruiters.

2. **Standardization**: These tools can help standardize the evaluation process, reducing bias and ensuring that all candidates are assessed against the same criteria.

3. **Efficiency**: By automating parts of the recruitment process, these tools can save time and resources, allowing HR teams to focus on more strategic tasks.

4. **Predictive Analytics**: Some tools use machine learning algorithms to predict a candidate's future performance based on historical data.

5. **Scalability**: Automated tools can handle a large number of applications simultaneously, making them particularly useful for organizations with high volumes of applicants.

However, there are also concerns associated with these tools, including potential biases in the algorithms, transparency issues, and the risk of overlooking qualified candidates due to overly rigid criteria.

This is particularly relevant in areas like artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analytics, where biased data or algorithms can perpetuate stereotypes or inequalities.

Key components of a bias audit typically include:

1. **Data Assessment**: Analyzing the data used in the system to identify any inherent biases, such as underrepresentation of certain groups.

2. **Algorithm Evaluation**: Reviewing the algorithms to see how they process data and whether they produce biased results.

3. **Impact Analysis**: Assessing the real-world effects of the system on different demographic groups to understand any disparities in outcomes.

4. **Recommendations**: Providing actionable steps to reduce bias, such as improving data diversity, adjusting algorithms, or implementing fairness metrics.

5. **Ongoing Monitoring**: Establishing a framework for continuous evaluation to ensure that biases are addressed over time.

What are the criteria for a bias audit?,"A bias audit of an AEDT must, at a minimum, calculate the selection rate for each category, calculate the impact ratio for each category, ensure that the calculations separately calculate the impact on sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories, and indicate the number of individuals not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category.","Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and

calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

These tools can analyze various data points, such as resumes, application forms, assessments, and even social media profiles, to evaluate candidates and predict their suitability for a position.

Key features of automated employment decision tools include:

1. **Data Analysis**: They process large volumes of data quickly, identifying patterns and trends that may not be immediately apparent to human recruiters.

2. **Standardization**: These tools can help standardize the evaluation process, reducing bias and ensuring that all candidates are assessed against the same criteria.

3. **Efficiency**: By automating parts of the hiring process, these tools can save time and resources, allowing HR teams to focus on more strategic tasks.

4. **Predictive Analytics**: Some tools use machine learning algorithms to predict a candidate's future performance based on historical data.

5. **Scalability**: Automated tools can handle a large number of applications simultaneously, making them useful for companies with high volumes of applicants.

However, there are also concerns regarding the use of these tools, such as potential biases in the algorithms, lack of transparency, and the risk of overlooking qualified candidates due to overly rigid criteria.

(2) Calculate the scoring rate for individuals in each category;

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino

(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job

using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer

What is the meaning of 'selection rate'?,'Selection rate' means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. It can be calculated by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.,"Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above

Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT.

Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;",[],"{'question_type': 'vague', 'seed_document_id': 9, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","Could you please clarify what specific results you're referring to?

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Here are the key functions of a bias audit in this context:

1. **Identification of Bias**: The primary role of a bias audit is to identify any biases present in the algorithms or data used by AEDTs. This includes examining whether certain demographic groups (e.g., based on race, gender, age) are unfairly disadvantaged or favored in the hiring process.

2. **Data Quality Assessment**: Audits assess the quality and representativeness of the data used to train the algorithms. Poor or biased data can lead to skewed outcomes, so ensuring that the data reflects a diverse and representative sample is essential.

3. **Algorithm Evaluation**: The audit evaluates the algorithms themselves to determine if they produce equitable outcomes. This involves analyzing how different variables influence decision-making and whether the model inadvertently perpetuates existing biases.

4. **Compliance with Regulations**: Many jurisdictions are implementing regulations around the use of AEDTs. A bias audit helps organizations ensure compliance with these laws, which may require transparency and fairness in automated hiring processes.

5. **Recommendations for Improvement**: After identifying biases, a bias audit provides actionable recommendations to mitigate these issues. This could involve adjusting algorithms, improving data collection practices, or implementing additional checks and balances in the hiring process.

6. **Transparency and Accountability**: Conducting a bias audit promotes transparency in the use of AEDTs. It helps organizations demonstrate their commitment to fair hiring practices and accountability, which can enhance their reputation and trust with candidates.

7. **Continuous Monitoring**: Bias audits are not a one-time activity; they should be part of an ongoing process to monitor and evaluate the performance of AEDTs over time. This ensures that any emerging biases can be addressed promptly.

8. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Engaging with stakeholders, including employees, candidates, and advocacy groups, during the audit process can provide valuable insights and foster a more inclusive approach to hiring.

In summary, a bias audit is essential for ensuring that automated employment decision tools operate fairly and equitably, helping organizations to make informed hiring decisions while minimizing the risk of discrimination.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed explanation of the role of a bias audit in relation to automated employment decision tools, but it does not align with the specific legal context and requirements mentioned in the ground truth answer.",0.1379310344827586,0.9911813735961914,5.0,"The generated answer comprehensively addresses the role of a bias audit in relation to automated employment decision tools, providing accurate and relevant information without any errors."

1. **Transparency**: Employers may be required to disclose the use of automated tools to candidates, explaining how the tool works and what data it uses.

2. **Fairness and Non-Discrimination**: Employers must ensure that the tool does not discriminate against any protected classes. This often involves conducting impact assessments to evaluate the tool's effects on different demographic groups.

3. **Data Privacy**: Compliance with data protection laws is essential. Employers must handle candidate data responsibly and ensure that personal information is secure.

4. **Validation and Testing**: Employers may need to validate the tool to ensure it accurately predicts job performance and does not introduce bias.

5. **Candidate Rights**: Candidates might have the right to request information about how the tool was used in their evaluation and to challenge decisions made by the tool.

6. **Record Keeping**: Employers may be required to maintain records of the tool's use, including data on its effectiveness and any complaints received.

7. **Compliance with Local Laws**: Specific cities may have additional regulations governing the use of automated employment decision tools, so it's important to check local laws.

3. **Text Messages**: Useful for quick updates or reminders, especially for scheduling interviews or follow-ups.

4. **Postal Mail**: Traditional but still effective for formal notices, especially for job offers or contracts.

5. **Online Portals**: Many companies use applicant tracking systems (ATS) where candidates can log in to check their application status and receive notifications.

6. **In-Person Meetings**: For final interviews or job offers, face-to-face communication can be more impactful.

7. **Social Media**: Some companies use platforms like LinkedIn to communicate with candidates, especially for networking or informal updates.

8. **Job Boards**: Notifications through job boards where candidates applied can also be a method, though less direct.

9. **Automated Notifications**: Some systems send automated emails or messages at various stages of the hiring process.

10. **Recruitment Events**: In-person or virtual job fairs can serve as a platform for providing updates and notices to multiple candidates.

§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.","[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'I would like to know the purpose of conducting a bias audit with the AEDT.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'How can I help you with that?'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'What is its purpose?'}]","{'question_type': 'conversational', 'seed_document_id': 13, 'topic': 'Definitions', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","The purpose of conducting a bias audit with the Artificial Employment Decision Tool (AEDT) is to identify and mitigate potential biases in automated hiring processes.

2. **Transparency**: Provide insights into how decisions are made by the AEDT, allowing stakeholders to understand the factors influencing hiring outcomes.

3. **Accountability**: Establish a framework for holding organizations accountable for the decisions made by the AEDT, promoting ethical use of technology in hiring.

4. **Improvement**: Identify areas for improvement in the algorithm or data used, leading to more equitable hiring practices.

5. **Compliance**: Help organizations meet legal and regulatory requirements related to fair hiring practices.

6. **Trust**: Build trust among candidates and the public by demonstrating a commitment to fair and unbiased hiring processes.

What is the objective?,"The purpose of a bias audit for an AEDT is to calculate the selection rate and impact ratio for different categories, such as sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectional categories. It also ensures that the calculations are performed for each group if the AEDT classifies candidates into specified groups.","Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

What are they?,"A bias audit of an AEDT must, at a minimum, calculate the selection rate for each category, calculate the impact ratio for each category, separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race, indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT that are not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category.","Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.","[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'I need to know the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'How can I help you with that?'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'What are they?'}]","{'question_type': 'conversational', 'seed_document_id': 5, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","Conducting a bias audit of an Automated Decision-Making Tool (AEDT) typically involves several key requirements and steps. While specific requirements can vary based on jurisdiction and the nature of the AEDT, here are some common elements to consider:

### 1. **Data Collection**
   - **Diverse Data Sources**: Ensure that the data used to train and test the AEDT is representative of the population it will serve.
   - **Data Quality**: Assess the quality of the data, including completeness, accuracy, and relevance.

### 2. **Stakeholder Engagement**
   - **Involve Diverse Stakeholders**: Engage with stakeholders, including affected communities, to understand their perspectives and concerns.
   - **Transparency**: Maintain transparency about the audit process and findings.

### 3. **Bias Identification**
   - **Define Bias**: Clearly define what constitutes bias in the context of the AEDT.
   - **Statistical Analysis**: Use statistical methods to identify potential biases in the model's predictions across different demographic groups.

### 4. **Model Evaluation**
   - **Performance Metrics**: Evaluate the model using fairness metrics (e.g., equal opportunity, disparate impact) alongside traditional performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision).
   - **Scenario Testing**: Test the model under various scenarios to assess how it performs across different groups.

### 5. **Documentation**
   - **Audit Trail**: Maintain thorough documentation of the audit process, including methodologies, findings, and any changes made to the model.
   - **Reporting**: Prepare a comprehensive report detailing the audit findings, including any identified biases and recommendations for mitigation.

### 6. **Mitigation Strategies**
   - **Bias Mitigation Techniques**: Implement strategies to reduce identified biases, such as re-sampling, re-weighting, or model adjustments.
   - **Continuous Monitoring**: Establish a plan for ongoing monitoring and re-evaluation of the AEDT to ensure that biases do not re-emerge over time.

### 7. **Compliance and Ethical Standards**
   - **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensure that the audit meets any relevant legal and regulatory requirements.
   - **Ethical Considerations**: Consider ethical implications and strive for fairness, accountability, and transparency in the AEDT's use.

### 8. **Feedback Mechanism**
   - **User Feedback**: Create channels for users and affected individuals to provide feedback on the AEDT's performance and any perceived biases.
   - **Iterative Improvement**: Use feedback to inform ongoing improvements to the AEDT.

### Conclusion
Conducting a bias audit is a complex process that requires a multidisciplinary approach, involving data scientists, ethicists, legal experts, and community representatives. The goal is to ensure that the AEDT operates fairly and equitably across all demographic groups.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed overview of conducting a bias audit of an Automated Decision-Making Tool (AEDT), but it does not directly address the specific requirements mentioned in the ground truth answer, which focuses on calculating selection rates, impact ratios, and assessing specific demographic categories.",0.0,0.3420032560825348,2.0,"The generated answer provides relevant information about conducting a bias audit of an AEDT but does not directly address the specific components mentioned in the reference answer, leading to significant inaccuracies."
What is it called?,'Test data' refers to data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.,"Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2)

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

This data is specifically designed to assess the performance of a model or system, particularly in identifying and measuring biases. It typically includes a diverse set of inputs that represent various demographic groups or scenarios to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of how the model behaves across different contexts.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed explanation of 'test data' in the context of a bias audit, but it does not directly address the ground truth definition, which specifies that 'test data' is data used for a bias audit that is not historical data.",0.0,0.4900466799736023,4.0,"The generated answer correctly identifies ""test data"" in the context of a bias audit and provides relevant details, but it introduces terms like ""audit data"" and ""evaluation data"" without explicitly confirming their equivalence to ""test data,"" which could lead to minor confusion."
What are they?,"A bias audit of an AEDT must, at a minimum, calculate the selection rate for each category, calculate the impact ratio for each category, separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories, and indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT that are not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category.","Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Document 6: 2 
 
 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.","[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'I need to know the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'How can I help you with that?'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'What are they?'}]","{'question_type': 'conversational', 'seed_document_id': 5, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","The requirements for a bias audit of an Automated Decision-Making Tool (AEDT) can vary depending on the jurisdiction and specific regulations in place.

data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT.

As used in this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings: 
 
Automated Employment Decision Tool. “Automated employment decision tool” or “AEDT” means 
“Automated employment decision tool” as defined by § 20-870 of the Code where the phrase “to

These tools aim to streamline the hiring process, reduce bias, and improve efficiency. However, they also raise concerns about fairness, transparency, and potential biases inherent in the algorithms used. As a result, there is increasing scrutiny and regulation around their use in employment decisions.",False,"The agent's answer provides a general definition of an automated employment decision tool but lacks the specific details and technical language found in the ground truth definition, which emphasizes computational processes and the impact on discretionary decision making.",0.2142857142857142,0.4606839716434479,4.0,"The generated answer correctly defines an automated employment decision tool and addresses its purpose and implications, but it lacks the specific detail about the computational processes involved as mentioned in the reference answer."
What should be included?,"The summary of results of a bias audit should include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios for all categories.","Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Here are some key objectives:

1. **Fairness**: Ensure that the tools do not discriminate against candidates based on protected characteristics such as race, gender, age, or disability.

2. **Transparency**: Provide insights into how decisions are made by the automated systems, making it easier to understand and explain outcomes.

3. **Compliance**: Help organizations adhere to legal and regulatory requirements related to equal employment opportunity and anti-discrimination laws.

4. **Improvement**: Identify areas for improvement in the algorithms and data sets, leading to more accurate and equitable hiring practices.

5. **Trust**: Build trust among candidates and stakeholders by demonstrating a commitment to fair and unbiased hiring processes.

6. **Risk Management**: Mitigate potential legal and reputational risks associated with biased hiring practices.

Overall, a bias audit aims to promote ethical and responsible use of technology in employment decisions, ensuring that all candidates are evaluated fairly.",False,The agent's answer provides a detailed explanation of the purpose of a bias audit but does not align with the specific legal context and requirements mentioned in the ground truth answer.,0.2,0.4716189503669739,4.0,"The generated answer correctly addresses the purpose of a bias audit for automated employment decision tools and provides relevant details, but it lacks specific legal references found in the reference answer."
What are the necessary details?,"A bias audit of an AEDT must, at a minimum, calculate the selection rate for each category, calculate the impact ratio for each category, separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories, and indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT that are not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category.","Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.","[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'I need to know the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'How can I help you with that?'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'What are the necessary details?'}]","{'question_type': 'conversational', 'seed_document_id': 5, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","Conducting a bias audit of an Automated Decision-Making Tool (AEDT) involves several key requirements and details. Here’s a breakdown:

### 1. **Objective of the Audit**
   - Define the purpose of the audit (e.g., compliance, risk assessment, improvement).

### 2. **Data Collection**
   - **Input Data**: Gather data used by the AEDT, including demographic information, historical data, and any relevant features.
   - **Output Data**: Collect the decisions made by the AEDT, including outcomes and any associated metrics.

### 3. **Stakeholder Engagement**
   - Identify stakeholders (e.g., developers, users, affected individuals) and involve them in the audit process.

### 4. **Bias Identification**
   - **Types of Bias**: Determine the types of bias to assess (e.g., selection bias, measurement bias, algorithmic bias).
   - **Metrics for Evaluation**: Establish metrics to measure bias (e.g., disparate impact, equal opportunity).

### 5. **Methodology**
   - Choose appropriate methodologies for the audit, such as statistical analysis, fairness metrics, or qualitative assessments.

### 6. **Testing and Validation**
   - Conduct tests to evaluate the performance of the AEDT across different demographic groups.
   - Validate findings through cross-validation or external benchmarking.

### 7. **Documentation**
   - Maintain thorough documentation of the audit process, findings, and methodologies used.

### 8. **Recommendations**
   - Provide actionable recommendations based on the audit findings to mitigate identified biases.

### 9. **Compliance and Standards**
   - Ensure adherence to relevant regulations, standards, and best practices in AI ethics and fairness.

### 10. **Follow-Up**
   - Plan for follow-up audits and continuous monitoring to ensure ongoing fairness and bias mitigation.

### 11. **Reporting**
   - Prepare a comprehensive report summarizing the audit process, findings, and recommendations for stakeholders.

### 12. **Transparency**
   - Ensure transparency in the audit process and findings, making them accessible to relevant stakeholders.

were received.  
 
Statement of Basis and Purpose 
 
The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP” or “Department”) is adding rules to implement 
new legislation regarding automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”). Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits 
employers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has 
been subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly 
available, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   
 
These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor's justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.",[],"{'question_type': 'out of scope', 'seed_document_id': 17, 'topic': 'Definitions', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': 'The AEDT is a software developed by a team of engineers.'}","The AEDT (Aviation Environmental Design Tool) software was developed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in collaboration with various stakeholders, including industry experts and researchers. While specific individual names may not be publicly highlighted, the development typically involves teams of engineers, environmental scientists, and software developers. For detailed information about the contributors, you might want to refer to official FAA publications or the AEDT documentation, which may list key contributors or project leads.",False,"The agent's answer implies that specific names may exist but are not highlighted, while the ground truth states that no specific names are mentioned in the documents.",0.0,0.0,3.0,"The generated answer provides relevant context about the AEDT software's development but fails to directly address the user's request for specific names, resulting in partial correctness."

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency's data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules,

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not

The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor's justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency's data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'out of scope', 'seed_document_id': 11, 'topic': 'Enforcement and Penalties', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': 'The bias audit of the AEDT must be conducted by an external third-party company.'}",The person responsible for conducting the bias audit of the AEDT (Algorithmic Equity and Data Transparency) is **Dr. J.

Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.  
 
 
 
    _________selection rate for a category________  
Impact Ratio =        selection rate of the most selected category  
 
OR 
 
  
 
     ______scoring rate for a category__________  
Impact Ratio =        scoring rate of the highest scoring category 
 
 
Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate's fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample's median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor's justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample's median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate's estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate's resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'out of scope', 'seed_document_id': 13, 'topic': 'Metrics/Data', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': 'The average age of the male applicants in the White category is 35.'}","To determine the average age of male applicants in the White category, you would need specific data regarding the ages of male applicants who fall into that category. If you have a dataset, you can calculate the average by following these steps:

1. **Filter the Data**: Select only the male applicants who are categorized as White.
2. **Sum the Ages**: Add together the ages of all the selected applicants.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency's data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT;

1. **Underrepresentation**: Non-binary individuals are often underrepresented in many sectors, which can affect their visibility and opportunities.

2. **Discrimination**: Non-binary applicants may experience bias or discrimination during hiring processes or admissions, impacting their success rates.

3. **Awareness and Policies**: Organizations with inclusive policies and training may show a more favorable impact ratio for non-binary applicants compared to those without such measures.

4. **Data Availability**: Comprehensive data on non-binary applicants is often limited, making it difficult to assess their impact ratio accurately.

posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit. The vendor provides historical data regarding

will conduct a bias audit as follows:

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency's data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;",[],"{'question_type': 'out of scope', 'seed_document_id': 12, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': 'The vendor provides historical data regarding applicant salary.'}","In Venezuela, vendors providing data on applicant selection typically offer various types of information, including:
