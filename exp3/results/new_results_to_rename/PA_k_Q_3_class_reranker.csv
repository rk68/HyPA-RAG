New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection 
 
Notice of Adoption of Final Rule 
 
Pursuant to the authority vested in the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection by 
Sections 1043 and 2203(f) of the New York City Charter and Section 20-104(b) of the New York City 
Administrative Code, and in accordance with the requirements of Section 1043 of the New York City Charter, 
the Department amends Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York.  
 
An initial version of this rule was proposed and published on September 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on 
November 4, 2022, and comments regarding the rule were received. DCWP proposed a second version of this 
rule on December 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on January 23, 2023, and comments regarding the rule 
were received.  
 
Statement of Basis and Purpose 
 
The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP” or “Department”) is adding rules to implement 
new legislation regarding automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”). Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits 
employers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has 
been subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly 
available, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   
 
These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

Historical data.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex_situational', 'seed_document_id': 0, 'topic': 'Requirements'}","Yes, I can help with that. According to Local Law 144 of 2021, an automated employment decision tool (AEDT) is defined as any computational process, derived from machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence, that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation, that is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons. 

Before using an AEDT to screen a candidate or employee for an employment decision, employers and employment agencies in New York City must meet the following conditions:

"In the context of a bias audit, what is the definition of 'test data' and when can it be used?",'Test data' refers to data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.,"Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded

Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

A bias audit is an impartial evaluation of an automated employment decision tool by an independent auditor to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of federal regulations. In simpler terms, a bias audit is a review of the tool to ensure that it does not unfairly discriminate against certain groups of people based on their race, gender, or other protected characteristics.

The purpose of requiring a bias audit for automated employment decision tools is to ensure that these tools are not perpetuating or exacerbating existing biases in the hiring process. By conducting a bias audit, employers can identify any potential issues with the tool and take steps to address them before using the tool to make employment decisions. This helps to promote fairness and equity in the hiring process and reduce the risk of discrimination claims.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed explanation of what a bias audit is and its purpose, but it does not accurately reflect the specific purpose stated in the ground truth, which focuses solely on assessing the tool's disparate impact as required by specific legal provisions.",0.9285714285714286,0.8414949178695679,5.0,"The generated answer accurately explains what a bias audit entails and why it is required, covering all components of the user query without any factual errors."
I'm reviewing a policy document and came across the term 'Impact Ratio.' Can you explain what it means and how it is calculated?,"The 'Impact Ratio' can be calculated as either the selection rate for a category divided by the selection rate of the most selected category, or the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the highest scoring category.","Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii.

It is a measure of the impact of an AEDT on different categories of candidates, such as sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectional categories. 

There are two ways to calculate the Impact Ratio:

1. Selection Rate Impact Ratio: The selection rate for a category is divided by the selection rate of the most selected category.

Impact Ratio = Selection rate for a category / Selection rate of the most selected category

2. Scoring Rate Impact Ratio: The scoring rate for a category is divided by the scoring rate for the highest scoring category.

Impact Ratio = Scoring rate for a category / Scoring rate for the highest scoring category

The Impact Ratio is used to identify any potential bias in the AEDT's selection or scoring process. If the Impact Ratio for a particular category is significantly lower than 1, it suggests that the AEDT is having a disproportionate impact on that category, which may indicate bias.",True,The agent's explanation of the Impact Ratio and its calculation methods aligns well with the ground truth answer.,0.625,0.7793448567390442,5.0,"The generated answer accurately explains the term 'Impact Ratio,' provides correct calculations, and includes relevant context about its use in bias audits, fully addressing the user query."

New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection 
 
Notice of Adoption of Final Rule 
 
Pursuant to the authority vested in the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection by 
Sections 1043 and 2203(f) of the New York City Charter and Section 20-104(b) of the New York City 
Administrative Code, and in accordance with the requirements of Section 1043 of the New York City Charter, 
the Department amends Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York.  
 
An initial version of this rule was proposed and published on September 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on 
November 4, 2022, and comments regarding the rule were received. DCWP proposed a second version of this 
rule on December 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on January 23, 2023, and comments regarding the rule 
were received.  
 
Statement of Basis and Purpose 
 
The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP” or “Department”) is adding rules to implement 
new legislation regarding automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”). Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits 
employers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has 
been subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly 
available, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   
 
These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and

The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with

“Shall” and “must” denote mandatory requirements and may be used interchangeably in the rules of this 
department, unless otherwise specified or unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus;

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex_situational', 'seed_document_id': 6, 'topic': 'Definitions'}","Yes, as per the rules established by the New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection, if you are an employer planning to use an AEDT for screening resumes and scheduling interviews, you must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the planned use of the AEDT. The bias audit must be conducted by an independent auditor who is not employed or does not have a financial interest in your company or the vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT.

The bias audit must calculate the selection rate for each category, including sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race. The impact ratio for each category must also be calculated separately. The impact ratio is determined by comparing the selection rates of each category to the most selected category. 

If the AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion into specified groups, the calculations required for each category must be performed for each group. The bias audit must also indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required calculations because they fall within an unknown category.

It is important to note that the bias audit must use historical data of the AEDT. If insufficient historical data is available, an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data. However, the summary of results of the bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was generated and obtained.",True,,1.0,0.8658082485198975,4.0,"The generated answer correctly addresses the requirements for conducting a bias audit of an AEDT, including the calculation of impact ratios and the need for independent auditors, but it could be slightly more concise and focused on the specific calculation of impact ratios."
I have been using an AEDT for 6 months and need to conduct a bias audit. Can I rely on my own historical data or do I need to provide data from other employers?,"A bias audit of an AEDT must, at a minimum, calculate the selection rate and impact ratio for each category, separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race, perform the calculations for each group if the AEDT classifies candidates into specified groups, and indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT that are not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category.","Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.

There are two ways to calculate the Impact Ratio:

1. Selection Rate Impact Ratio: This is calculated by dividing the selection rate for a category by the selection rate of the most selected category.

Impact Ratio = Selection rate for a category / Selection rate of the most selected category

2. Scoring Rate Impact Ratio: This is calculated by dividing the scoring rate for a category by the scoring rate for the highest scoring category.

Impact Ratio = Scoring rate for a category / Scoring rate for the highest scoring category

The Impact Ratio is calculated separately for each category, such as sex, race, or ethnicity, and is used to determine whether the AEDT has a disparate impact on any particular category.

calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of

for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and,

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Section 1.  Chapter 5 of Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York is amended to add Subchapter T to read 
as follows: 
Subchapter T: Automated Employment Decision Tools 
§ 5-300. Definitions. 
As used in this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings: 
 
Automated Employment Decision Tool. “Automated employment decision tool” or “AEDT” means 
“Automated employment decision tool” as defined by § 20-870 of the Code where the phrase “to 
substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making” means: 
i. 
to rely solely on a simplified output (score, tag, classification, ranking, etc.), with no other 
factors considered; or 
ii. 
 to use a simplified output as one of a set of criteria where the simplified output is weighted 
more than any other criterion in the set; or   
iii. 
to use a simplified output to overrule conclusions derived from other factors including 
human decision-making.  
  
Bias Audit. “Bias audit” means “Bias audit” as defined by § 20-870 of the Code.  
 
Candidate for Employment. “Candidate for employment” means a person who has applied for a specific 
employment position by submitting the necessary information or items in the format required by the 
employer or employment agency.  
 
Category. “Category” means any component 1 category required to be reported by employers pursuant 
to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States Code as specified in part 1602.7 of 
title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, as designated on the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission Employer Information Report EEO-1. 
 
Code. “Code” means the Administrative Code of the City of New York. 
 
Distribution Date. “Distribution date” means the date the employer or employment agency began using 
a specific AEDT.  
 
Employment Decision. “Employment decision” means “Employment decision” as defined by § 20-870 
of the Code. 
 
Employment Agency. “Employment agency” means “Employment agency” as defined by 6 RCNY § 5-
249.

However, it does not include tools that do not automate, support, substantially assist, or replace discretionary decision-making processes and that do not materially impact natural persons.",False,"The agent's answer includes additional information about exclusions that is not present in the ground truth definition, making it longer and not a direct match.",1.0,0.8466994166374207,4.0,"The generated answer accurately defines an automated employment decision tool and includes relevant details, but the additional information about exclusions is not part of the original definition, which slightly detracts from its overall correctness."
What must a bias audit of an AEDT calculate?,"A bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate and impact ratio for each category, including sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race. It must also indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT that fall within an unknown category.","Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT.

Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.  
 
 
 
    _________selection rate for a category________

     ______scoring rate for a category__________  
Impact Ratio =        scoring rate of the highest scoring category 
 
 
Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 


New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection 
 
Notice of Adoption of Final Rule 
 
Pursuant to the authority vested in the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection by 
Sections 1043 and 2203(f) of the New York City Charter and Section 20-104(b) of the New York City 
Administrative Code, and in accordance with the requirements of Section 1043 of the New York City Charter, 
the Department amends Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York.  
 
An initial version of this rule was proposed and published on September 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on 
November 4, 2022, and comments regarding the rule were received. DCWP proposed a second version of this 
rule on December 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on January 23, 2023, and comments regarding the rule 
were received.  
 
Statement of Basis and Purpose 
 
The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP” or “Department”) is adding rules to implement 
new legislation regarding automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”). Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits 
employers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has 
been subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly 
available, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   
 
These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.

Automated Employment Decision Tools
§ 20-870 Definitions. For the purposes of this subchapter, the following terms have the following
meanings:
Automated employment decision tool. The term “automated employment decision tool” means any
computational process, derived from machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial
intelligence, that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation, that is used to
substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for making employment decisions that impact
natural persons. The term “automated employment decision tool” does not include a tool that does not
automate, support, substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-making processes and that does not
materially impact natural persons, including, but not limited to, a junk email filter, firewall, antivirus software,
calculator, spreadsheet, database, data set, or other compilation of data.
Bias audit. The term “bias audit” means an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor. Such bias
audit shall include but not be limited to the testing of an automated employment decision tool to assess the

audit shall include but not be limited to the testing of an automated employment decision tool to assess the
tool’s disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported by employers pursuant
to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of
the code of federal regulations.
Employment decision. The term “employment decision” means to screen candidates for employment or
employees for promotion within the city.
§ 20-871 Requirements for automated employment decision tools. a. In the city, it shall be unlawful for

What are the calculations required in the bias audit for the impact ratio?,"The calculations required in the bias audit for the impact ratio include separately calculating the impact of the AEDT on sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates), race/ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American female candidates).","Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'simple', 'seed_document_id': 15, 'topic': 'Metrics/Data', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","The calculations required in the bias audit for the impact ratio are:

1. For selection rate: the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.

2. For scoring rate: the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT.

The impact ratio can be calculated using either of the following formulas:

1. Selection rate impact ratio: selection rate for a category divided by the selection rate of the most selected category.

2. Scoring rate impact ratio: scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the highest scoring category.",False,"The agent's answer focuses on selection and scoring rates but does not address the need to calculate the impact of the AEDT on specific demographic categories such as sex and race/ethnicity, which is essential for the bias audit.",1.0,0.9955137968063354,4.0,"The generated answer correctly addresses the calculations required for the bias audit and provides detailed formulas, but it lacks specific mention of the intersectional categories as highlighted in the reference answer."

audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the median score for the full sample of applicants;  
(2) Calculate the scoring rate for individuals in each category;

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;",[],"{'question_type': 'simple', 'seed_document_id': 14, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","According to Subchapter T of Chapter 5 of Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York, a bias audit of an AEDT must, at a minimum:

1. Calculate the selection rate for each category;
2. Calculate the impact ratio for each category;
3. Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race;

5. Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required calculations because they fall within an unknown category.

Additionally, where an AEDT scores candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion, a bias audit must, at a minimum:

1. Calculate the median score for the full sample of applicants;
2. Calculate the scoring rate for individuals in each category.

An independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio, but must include the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded category in the summary of results, along with the auditor's justification for the exclusion.",False,The agent's answer is overly detailed and includes additional requirements that are not part of the ground truth answer.

§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT.

making processes and that does not materially impact natural persons, including, but not limited to, a junk email filter, firewall, antivirus software,
calculator, spreadsheet, database, data set, or other compilation of data.
   Bias audit. The term ""bias audit"" means an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor. Such bias audit shall include but not be limited to the
testing of an automated employment decision tool to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported
by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of
federal regulations.
   Employment decision. The term ""employment decision"" means to screen candidates for employment or employees for promotion within the city.

§ 20-871 Requirements for automated employment decision tools.
   a.   In the city, it shall be unlawful for an employer or an employment agency to use an automated employment decision tool to screen a candidate or
employee for an employment decision unless:
      1.   Such tool has been the subject of a bias audit conducted no more than one year prior to the use of such tool; and
      2.   A summary of the results of the most recent bias audit of such tool as well as the distribution date of the tool to which such audit applies has been
made publicly available on the website of the employer or employment agency prior to the use of such tool.
   b.   Notices required.",[],"{'question_type': 'simple', 'seed_document_id': 23, 'topic': 'Definitions', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}",The purpose of a bias audit for automated employment decision tools is to evaluate the tool's potential disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of federal regulations. The audit is conducted by an independent auditor and includes testing the tool to assess its impact on different categories of individuals. The results of the bias audit must be made publicly available on the website of the employer or employment agency prior to the use of the tool. The goal is to ensure that the tool is not unfairly biased against any particular group of individuals and to promote fair and equitable employment practices.,False,"The agent's answer is overly detailed and includes information about the audit process and requirements that are not part of the ground truth. The ground truth focuses specifically on assessing the tool's disparate impact, which the agent does mention, but the additional details make the answer incorrect.",0.9166666666666666,1.0,4.0,"The generated answer is mostly correct, addressing the purpose of a bias audit and its implications, but it includes excessive detail that, while accurate, is not necessary for the query."
What are the requirements for the published results of the bias audit?,The requirements for the published results of the required bias audit are clarified in the new rules. These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category that is required to be reported to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to determine an impact ratio.,"Document 9: 4 
 
iii. 
at any point during the bias audit, has a direct financial interest or a material indirect 
financial interest in an employer or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to 
use the  AEDT or in a vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT. 
 
Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.  
 
 
 
    _________selection rate for a category________  
Impact Ratio =        selection rate of the most selected category  
 
OR 
 
  
 
     ______scoring rate for a category__________  
Impact Ratio =        scoring rate of the highest scoring category 
 
 
Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;",[],"{'question_type': 'simple', 'seed_document_id': 9, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","According to § 5-303(a) of the Rules of the City of New York, before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and,

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex', 'seed_document_id': 11, 'topic': 'Metrics/Data', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","According to the information provided, the specific calculations and requirements for conducting a bias audit of an AEDT are as follows:

1. Calculate the selection rate for each category.
2. Calculate the impact ratio for each category.
3. Ensure that the calculations separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race.
4. Ensure that the calculations are performed for each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion into specified groups.
5. Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required calculations because they fall within an unknown category.

Additionally, if an AEDT scores candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion, a bias audit must:

1. Calculate the median score for the full sample of applicants.
2. Calculate the scoring rate for individuals in each category.

The categories that need to be considered are any component 1 category required to be reported by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States Code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, as designated on the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Employer Information Report EEO-1.

Historical data or test data can be used to conduct a bias audit, and multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit. The number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must be included in the summary of results.",False,"The agent's answer provides excessive detail beyond the minimum requirements stated in the ground truth.

What is the definition of 'Impact Ratio' and how is it calculated in relation to the selection rate or scoring rate of different categories?,"The 'Impact Ratio' can be calculated either as the selection rate for a category divided by the selection rate of the most selected category, or as the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the highest scoring category.","Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate),

financial interest in an employer or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to 
use the  AEDT or in a vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT. 
 
Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the

Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.

What is the difference between historical data and test data in the context of conducting a bias audit for an AEDT?,'Test data' refers to data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.,"Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection 
 
Notice of Adoption of Final Rule 
 
Pursuant to the authority vested in the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection by 
Sections 1043 and 2203(f) of the New York City Charter and Section 20-104(b) of the New York City 
Administrative Code, and in accordance with the requirements of Section 1043 of the New York City Charter, 
the Department amends Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York.  
 
An initial version of this rule was proposed and published on September 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on 
November 4, 2022, and comments regarding the rule were received. DCWP proposed a second version of this 
rule on December 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on January 23, 2023, and comments regarding the rule 
were received.  
 
Statement of Basis and Purpose 
 
The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP” or “Department”) is adding rules to implement 
new legislation regarding automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”). Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits 
employers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has 
been subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly 
available, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   
 
These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

A Local Law to amend the administrative code of the city of New York, in relation to automated employment
decision tools
Be it enacted by the Council as follows:
Section 1. Chapter 5 of title 20 of the administrative code of the city of New York is amended by adding
a new subchapter 25 to read as follows:
Subchapter 25
Automated Employment Decision Tools
§ 20-870 Definitions. For the purposes of this subchapter, the following terms have the following
meanings:
Automated employment decision tool. The term “automated employment decision tool” means any
computational process, derived from machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial
intelligence, that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation, that is used to
substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for making employment decisions that impact
natural persons. The term “automated employment decision tool” does not include a tool that does not
automate, support, substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-making processes and that does not
materially impact natural persons, including, but not limited to, a junk email filter, firewall, antivirus software,
calculator, spreadsheet, database, data set, or other compilation of data.
Bias audit. The term “bias audit” means an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor. Such bias
audit shall include but not be limited to the testing of an automated employment decision tool to assess the

The audit must also indicate the number of individuals excluded from the calculations due to falling within an unknown category.","Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American

calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor's justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex', 'seed_document_id': 15, 'topic': 'Metrics/Data', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","According to section 5-301 of the rules, a bias audit of an AEDT that selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion must, at a minimum:

1. Calculate the selection rate for each category.
2. Calculate the impact ratio for each category.
3. Ensure that the calculations required in steps 1 and 2 separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on:
   i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),
   ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and
   iii. Intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American female candidates).
4. Ensure that the calculations in steps 1, 2, and 3 are performed for each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles).
5. Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required calculations because they fall within an unknown category.

The impact ratio is defined as either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the highest scoring category. The selection rate is the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. The scoring rate is the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT.

The bias audit must also indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and this number must be included in the summary of results.

What information does an employer or employment agency need to make publicly available before using an AEDT?,"Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency must make publicly available on the employment section of their website the date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results. The summary should include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT that fall within an unknown category, and the number of applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios for all categories.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit. The vendor provides historical data regarding 
applicant selection that the vendor has collected from multiple employers to an independent auditor who 
will conduct a bias audit as follows:

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT.

employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex', 'seed_document_id': 11, 'topic': 'Metrics/Data', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","According to the rules outlined in the document, a bias audit of an AEDT for candidate selection or promotion must, at a minimum, perform the following calculations:

3. Calculate the impact ratio for each category.
4. Ensure that the calculations required in (1), (2), and (3) separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on:

(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

"What are the specific calculations and requirements that must be performed during a bias audit of an AEDT for selection rates, impact ratios, and categories of sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectionality?","A bias audit of an AEDT must, at a minimum, calculate the selection rate for each category, calculate the impact ratio for each category, ensure that the calculations separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories, and indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT that are not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category.","Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Document 6: 2 
 
 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex', 'seed_document_id': 5, 'topic': 'Metrics/Data', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","During a bias audit of an AEDT for selection rates, impact ratios, and categories of sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectionality, the following calculations and requirements must be performed:

3. Ensure that the calculations required in steps 1 and 2 separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on:

the Department amends Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York.  
 
An initial version of this rule was proposed and published on September 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on 
November 4, 2022, and comments regarding the rule were received. DCWP proposed a second version of this 
rule on December 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on January 23, 2023, and comments regarding the rule 
were received.  
 
Statement of Basis and Purpose 
 
The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP” or “Department”) is adding rules to implement 
new legislation regarding automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”). Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits 
employers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has 
been subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly 
available, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   
 
These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

Section 1.  Chapter 5 of Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York is amended to add Subchapter T to read 
as follows: 
Subchapter T: Automated Employment Decision Tools 
§ 5-300. Definitions. 
As used in this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings: 
 
Automated Employment Decision Tool. “Automated employment decision tool” or “AEDT” means 
“Automated employment decision tool” as defined by § 20-870 of the Code where the phrase “to 
substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making” means: 
i. 
to rely solely on a simplified output (score, tag, classification, ranking, etc.), with no other 
factors considered; or 
ii. 
 to use a simplified output as one of a set of criteria where the simplified output is weighted 
more than any other criterion in the set; or   
iii. 
to use a simplified output to overrule conclusions derived from other factors including 
human decision-making.  
  
Bias Audit. “Bias audit” means “Bias audit” as defined by § 20-870 of the Code.  
 
Candidate for Employment. “Candidate for employment” means a person who has applied for a specific 
employment position by submitting the necessary information or items in the format required by the 
employer or employment agency.  
 
Category. “Category” means any component 1 category required to be reported by employers pursuant 
to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States Code as specified in part 1602.7 of 
title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, as designated on the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission Employer Information Report EEO-1. 
 
Code. “Code” means the Administrative Code of the City of New York. 
 
Distribution Date. “Distribution date” means the date the employer or employment agency began using 
a specific AEDT.  
 
Employment Decision. “Employment decision” means “Employment decision” as defined by § 20-870 
of the Code. 
 
Employment Agency. “Employment agency” means “Employment agency” as defined by 6 RCNY § 5-
249.  
 
Historical data.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex', 'seed_document_id': 4, 'topic': 'Definitions', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","In the context of automated employment decision tools, 'Bias Audit' refers to an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of federal regulations. The audit is required to be conducted no more than one year prior to the use of the tool and the results of the most recent bias audit must be made publicly available on the website of the employer or employment agency prior to the use of the tool.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed explanation of a bias audit in the context of automated employment decision tools, but it does not match the ground truth definition, which specifically refers to the definition as stated in § 20-870 of the Code.",1.0,0.965272068977356,4.0,"The generated answer provides a detailed and mostly accurate explanation of 'Bias Audit' in the context of automated employment decision tools, addressing the query well, but it does not directly reference the specific definition from the Code as indicated in the reference answer."
What is the distinction between historical data and test data in the context of conducting a bias audit for an AEDT?,Test data refers to data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.,"Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex', 'seed_document_id': 18, 'topic': 'Definitions', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","In the context of conducting a bias audit for an AEDT, historical data refers to data that has been collected from the actual use of the AEDT in the past by one or more employers or employment agencies. On the other hand, test data refers to data that is not historical and is used specifically for conducting a bias audit. Test data is typically generated for the purpose of conducting a bias audit and may not necessarily reflect the actual data that the AEDT will encounter in real-world use. An employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if there is insufficient historical data available to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. However, if a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was generated and obtained.",False,"The agent's answer is overly detailed and includes correct information, but it does not directly address the distinction as simply as the ground truth does.

Under what condition can an independent auditor exclude a category from the required calculations for impact ratio?,An independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio.,"Document 16: (d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT. 
The employer provides historical data on “culture fit” score of applicants for each category to an 
independent auditor to conduct a bias audit as follows:

Document 0: Subchapter 25: Automated Employment Decision Tools
§ 20-870 Definitions.
For the purposes of this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings:
   Automated employment decision tool. The term ""automated employment decision tool"" means any computational process, derived from machine
learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence, that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation,
that is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons. The term
""automated employment decision tool"" does not include a tool that does not automate, support, substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-
making processes and that does not materially impact natural persons, including, but not limited to, a junk email filter, firewall, antivirus software,
calculator, spreadsheet, database, data set, or other compilation of data.
   Bias audit. The term ""bias audit"" means an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor. Such bias audit shall include but not be limited to the
testing of an automated employment decision tool to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported
by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of

What are the criteria and calculations required for conducting a bias audit on the published results of an AEDT?,The published results of a bias audit must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category required to be reported to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to determine an impact ratio.,"Document 9: 4 
 
iii. 
at any point during the bias audit, has a direct financial interest or a material indirect 
financial interest in an employer or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to 
use the  AEDT or in a vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT. 
 
Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.  
 
 
 
    _________selection rate for a category________  
Impact Ratio =        selection rate of the most selected category  
 
OR 
 
  
 
     ______scoring rate for a category__________  
Impact Ratio =        scoring rate of the highest scoring category 
 
 
Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;",[],"{'question_type': 'complex', 'seed_document_id': 9, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","According to the rules outlined in Subchapter T of Chapter 5 of Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York, a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to determine an impact ratio.

§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT.

The bias audit must also separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race.

What is the process for calculating the impact ratio in a bias audit of an AEDT?,A bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category that is required to be reported to the EEOC and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to determine an impact ratio.

iii. 
at any point during the bias audit, has a direct financial interest or a material indirect 
financial interest in an employer or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to 
use the  AEDT or in a vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT. 
 
Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.  
 
 
 
    _________selection rate for a category________  
Impact Ratio =        selection rate of the most selected category  
 
OR 
 
  
 
     ______scoring rate for a category__________  
Impact Ratio =        scoring rate of the highest scoring category 
 
 
Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or

(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American

Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the

Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on

§ 20-870 Definitions.
For the purposes of this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings:
   Automated employment decision tool. The term ""automated employment decision tool"" means any computational process, derived from machine
learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence, that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation,
that is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons. The term
""automated employment decision tool"" does not include a tool that does not automate, support, substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-
making processes and that does not materially impact natural persons, including, but not limited to, a junk email filter, firewall, antivirus software,
calculator, spreadsheet, database, data set, or other compilation of data.
   Bias audit. The term ""bias audit"" means an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor. Such bias audit shall include but not be limited to the
testing of an automated employment decision tool to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported
by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of
federal regulations.
   Employment decision. The term ""employment decision"" means to screen candidates for employment or employees for promotion within the city.

What criteria must be met in order to exclude a category from the required calculations for the impact ratio in a bias audit of an AEDT?,"A bias audit of an AEDT must, at a minimum, calculate the selection rate for each category, calculate the impact ratio for each category, ensure that the calculations separately calculate the impact on sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories, and indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT that are not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category.","Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.

What calculations are required for a bias audit of an AEDT according to the new rules?,"A bias audit of an AEDT must, at a minimum, calculate the selection rate for each category, calculate the impact ratio for each category, separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories, and indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT that are not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category.","Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Document 6: 2 
 
 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

“Shall” and “must” denote mandatory requirements and may be used interchangeably in the rules of this 
department, unless otherwise specified or unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.",[],"{'question_type': 'distracting element', 'seed_document_id': 5, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': 'These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and \nsex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) \npursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to \ndetermine an impact ratio.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision

ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and

calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and

the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;",[],"{'question_type': 'distracting element', 'seed_document_id': 14, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': 'Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job \nposting.

at any point during the bias audit, has a direct financial interest or a material indirect 
financial interest in an employer or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to 
use the  AEDT or in a vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT. 
 
Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.  
 
 
 
    _________selection rate for a category________

Impact Ratio =        scoring rate of the highest scoring category 
 
 
Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 


"When conducting a bias audit for an AEDT, is it necessary to calculate the impact ratio for each race/ethnicity and sex category separately?",The purpose of a bias audit for an AEDT is to calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category required to be reported to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to determine an impact ratio.,"Document 9: 4 
 
iii. 
at any point during the bias audit, has a direct financial interest or a material indirect 
financial interest in an employer or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to 
use the  AEDT or in a vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT. 
 
Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.  
 
 
 
    _________selection rate for a category________  
Impact Ratio =        selection rate of the most selected category  
 
OR 
 
  
 
     ______scoring rate for a category__________  
Impact Ratio =        scoring rate of the highest scoring category 
 
 
Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than

using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and

calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.

"I'm considering using an AEDT for the first time. Can I rely on a bias audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or can I conduct a bias audit using test data? What is the definition of 'test data' in the context of a bias audit?",'Test data' refers to data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.,"Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection 
 
Notice of Adoption of Final Rule 
 
Pursuant to the authority vested in the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection by 
Sections 1043 and 2203(f) of the New York City Charter and Section 20-104(b) of the New York City 
Administrative Code, and in accordance with the requirements of Section 1043 of the New York City Charter, 
the Department amends Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York.  
 
An initial version of this rule was proposed and published on September 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on 
November 4, 2022, and comments regarding the rule were received. DCWP proposed a second version of this 
rule on December 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on January 23, 2023, and comments regarding the rule 
were received.  
 
Statement of Basis and Purpose 
 
The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP” or “Department”) is adding rules to implement 
new legislation regarding automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”). Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits 
employers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has 
been subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly 
available, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   
 
These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

Can you explain the meaning of test data in the context of a bias audit according to Local Law 144 and other policy documents?,Test data refers to data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.,"Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or

Historical data is data that has been collected from the actual use of an automated employment decision tool (AEDT) in the past. Test data, on the other hand, is generated specifically for the purpose of conducting a bias audit. 

Test data may be used when there is insufficient historical data available to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. In such cases, an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data. However, the summary of results of the bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was generated and obtained. 

It is important to note that the use of test data is subject to certain limitations and requirements, as outlined in Local Law 144 and other policy documents. For example, an employer or employment agency may only use test data if there is insufficient historical data available, and the use of test data must be clearly disclosed in the summary of results of the bias audit.",False,"The agent's answer is overly detailed and includes information beyond the ground truth, which simply defines test data.

"I am an employer using an AEDT to score applicants for 'culture fit' and want to ensure a bias audit was conducted before using the AEDT. What is the threshold for excluding a category, such as sex or race/ethnicity, from the required calculations for impact ratio?",An independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio.,"Document 16: (d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.

ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.",[],"{'question_type': 'situational', 'seed_document_id': 16, 'topic': 'Metrics/Data', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': '{""context"": ""An employer is using an AEDT to score applicants for \'culture fit\' and wants to ensure a bias audit was conducted before using the AEDT."", \n ""description"": ""An employer wants to calculate the impact ratio for each category, including sex and race/ethnicity, and ensure that the calculations accurately represent the data being used for the bias audit.""}', 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","According to the text, an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio.

"As a lawyer reviewing the requirements for bias audits in accordance with Local Law 144, can you explain what 'test data' means in the context of a bias audit?","In the context of a bias audit, 'test data' refers to data used to conduct the audit that is not historical data.","Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

What are the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT according to Local Law 144 and other policy documents?,"A bias audit of an AEDT must, at a minimum, calculate the selection rate for each category, calculate the impact ratio for each category, ensure that the impact calculations are done separately for sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories, and indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT that are not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category.","Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Document 6: 2 
 
 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than

(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment

"As a student from Canada who will be studying in Europe, what can an independent auditor exclude from the required calculations for impact ratio?",An independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio.,"Document 16: (d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of

category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.  
 
 
 
    _________selection rate for a category________

Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.

candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;",[],"{'question_type': 'situational', 'seed_document_id': 9, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': '{""question"": ""What is the purpose of the AEDT bias audit?""}', 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","According to § 5-303(a) of the law, before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit. The vendor provides historical data regarding 
applicant selection that the vendor has collected from multiple employers to an independent auditor who 
will conduct a bias audit as follows:

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available

I'm reviewing policy documents related to bias audits and I'm seeking clarification on the definition of 'Impact Ratio'. Can you explain what 'Impact Ratio' means?,"The 'Impact Ratio' can be calculated as either the selection rate for a category divided by the selection rate of the most selected category, or the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the highest scoring category.","Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a

Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve

In other words, the impact ratio is a measure of the relative impact that an automated employment decision tool (AEDT) has on different categories of individuals. It compares the selection rate or scoring rate for a particular category (e.g. Hispanic or Latino candidates) to the selection rate or scoring rate for the most selected or highest scoring category (e.g. White candidates). 

The resulting ratio indicates whether the AEDT is having a disproportionate impact on certain categories of individuals, which could be an indication of bias. A ratio of 1.0 indicates no impact, while a ratio below 1.0 indicates a lower impact and a ratio above 1.0 indicates a higher impact.",True,"The agent's explanation of 'Impact Ratio' aligns closely with the ground truth definition, providing additional context and examples that enhance understanding.",1.0,0.8747100830078125,5.0,"The generated answer accurately defines 'Impact Ratio' and provides additional relevant context, fully addressing the user query without any errors."

New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection 
 
Notice of Adoption of Final Rule 
 
Pursuant to the authority vested in the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection by 
Sections 1043 and 2203(f) of the New York City Charter and Section 20-104(b) of the New York City 
Administrative Code, and in accordance with the requirements of Section 1043 of the New York City Charter, 
the Department amends Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York.  
 
An initial version of this rule was proposed and published on September 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on 
November 4, 2022, and comments regarding the rule were received. DCWP proposed a second version of this 
rule on December 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on January 23, 2023, and comments regarding the rule 
were received.  
 
Statement of Basis and Purpose 
 
The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP” or “Department”) is adding rules to implement 
new legislation regarding automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”). Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits 
employers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has 
been subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly 
available, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   
 
These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

as follows: 
Subchapter T: Automated Employment Decision Tools 
§ 5-300. Definitions. 
As used in this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings: 
 
Automated Employment Decision Tool. “Automated employment decision tool” or “AEDT” means 
“Automated employment decision tool” as defined by § 20-870 of the Code where the phrase “to 
substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making” means: 
i. 
to rely solely on a simplified output (score, tag, classification, ranking, etc.), with no other

It's important to note that an AEDT does not include a tool that does not automate, support, substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-making processes and that does not materially impact natural persons, including, but not limited to, a junk email filter, firewall, antivirus software, calculator, spreadsheet, database, data set, or other compilation of data. 

If your company is using an AEDT for employment decisions, it must comply with certain requirements, including conducting a bias audit within one year of using the tool, making information about the bias audit publicly available, and providing certain notices to employees or job candidates.

may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT.

Document 0: Subchapter 25: Automated Employment Decision Tools
§ 20-870 Definitions.
For the purposes of this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings:
   Automated employment decision tool. The term ""automated employment decision tool"" means any computational process, derived from machine
learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence, that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation,
that is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons. The term
""automated employment decision tool"" does not include a tool that does not automate, support, substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-
making processes and that does not materially impact natural persons, including, but not limited to, a junk email filter, firewall, antivirus software,
calculator, spreadsheet, database, data set, or other compilation of data.
   Bias audit. The term ""bias audit"" means an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor. Such bias audit shall include but not be limited to the
testing of an automated employment decision tool to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported
by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of
federal regulations.

What are the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT and what changes were made in the second version of the proposed rules?,"The requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT include calculating the selection rate and impact ratio for each category. In the second version of the proposed rules, changes were made to the definition of AEDT and the requirements for an independent auditor were clarified.","Document 14: Data 
on those individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
(c) Where an AEDT scores candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion, a bias 
audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the median score for the full sample of applicants;  
(2) Calculate the scoring rate for individuals in each category;

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus;

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.

What are the requirements for a bias audit and what is test data in the context of a bias audit?,The requirements for a bias audit include calculating the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category and comparing the selection rates to determine an impact ratio. Test data in the context of a bias audit refers to data used to conduct the audit that is not historical data.,"Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Document 6: 2 
 
 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.",[],"{'question_type': 'double', 'seed_document_id': 5, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': [{'question': 'What are the requirements for a bias audit?', 'answer': 'A bias audit must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category and compare the selection rates to determine an impact ratio.'}, {'question': 'What is test data in the context of a bias audit?', 'answer': 'Test data is data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.'}], 'fake_fact': None}","According to the text, the requirements for a bias audit of an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT) include:

- Calculation of the selection rate and impact ratio for each category
- Separate calculation of the impact of the AEDT on sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories
- Performance of calculations for each group, if the AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion into specified groups

- Exclusion of a category that represents less than 2% of the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio, with justification for the exclusion and inclusion of the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded category in the summary of results

Test data, in the context of a bias audit, refers to data used to conduct the audit that is not historical data. It may be used if insufficient historical data is available to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was generated and obtained.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed list of requirements for a bias audit, which is more extensive than the ground truth.

What is the definition of 'test data' and what are the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT?,"Test data means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. A bias audit must calculate the selection rate and impact ratio for each category, including sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectional categories.","Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and,

What is the definition of test data and what are the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT?,"Test data means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. A bias audit must calculate the selection rate and impact ratio for each category, including sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories.","Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.

What are the requirements for a bias audit and what is test data?,The requirements for a bias audit include calculating the selection rate and impact ratio for each category. Test data is the data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.,"Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Document 6: 2 
 
 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.",[],"{'question_type': 'double', 'seed_document_id': 5, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': [{'question': 'What are the requirements for a bias audit?', 'answer': 'A bias audit must calculate the selection rate for each category and the impact ratio for each category.'}, {'question': 'What is test data?', 'answer': 'Test data is data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.'}], 'fake_fact': None}","According to the text, the requirements for a bias audit of an automated employment decision tool (AEDT) include:

- Calculation of the selection rate and impact ratio for each category, including sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories.
- Performance of calculations for each group, if the AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion into specified groups.
- Indication of the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required calculations because they fall within an unknown category.
- Use of historical data of the AEDT to conduct the bias audit, unless insufficient historical data is available to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.
- Publication of a summary of the results of the most recent bias audit, including the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios for all categories.
- Use of an independent auditor to conduct the bias audit.

Test data refers to data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. An employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.

They can provide notice on the employment section of its website, in a job posting, or via U.S. mail or e-mail.","Document 22: 10 
 
(2) Provide notice in a job posting at least 10 business days before use of an AEDT; or,

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and,

 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

“Shall” and “must” denote mandatory requirements and may be used interchangeably in the rules of this 
department, unless otherwise specified or unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.

What is the purpose of a bias audit and under what circumstances can an employer rely on it using historical data from other employers?,The purpose of a bias audit is to calculate the impact ratio and selection rate of an AEDT on different categories. An employer can rely on a bias audit using historical data from other employers if they provided their own historical data or if they have never used the AEDT.,"Document 17: 8

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.

Document 0: Subchapter 25: Automated Employment Decision Tools
§ 20-870 Definitions.
For the purposes of this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings:
   Automated employment decision tool. The term ""automated employment decision tool"" means any computational process, derived from machine
learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence, that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation,
that is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons. The term
""automated employment decision tool"" does not include a tool that does not automate, support, substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-
making processes and that does not materially impact natural persons, including, but not limited to, a junk email filter, firewall, antivirus software,
calculator, spreadsheet, database, data set, or other compilation of data.
   Bias audit. The term ""bias audit"" means an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor. Such bias audit shall include but not be limited to the
testing of an automated employment decision tool to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported
by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of
federal regulations.

What is the relationship between the definition of 'test data' in a bias audit and the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT?,"In a bias audit, 'test data' refers to the data used for the audit that is not historical data. On the other hand, a bias audit of an AEDT requires calculating the selection rate and impact ratio for each category, including sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectional categories. Therefore, the definition of 'test data' in a bias audit is distinct from the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT, but both are crucial components of ensuring fairness and identifying potential biases in automated systems.","Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

How does the data requirements for a bias audit relate to the process of assessing the impact of an AEDT on different categories?,"A bias audit is a process used to assess the impact of an AEDT on different categories, such as sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectional categories. The data requirements for a bias audit involve using historical data of the AEDT.

In both cases, the goal is to evaluate any potential biases and disparities in the AEDT's impact on different categories.","Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test

§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT.

Section 1.  Chapter 5 of Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York is amended to add Subchapter T to read 
as follows: 
Subchapter T: Automated Employment Decision Tools 
§ 5-300. Definitions. 
As used in this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings: 
 
Automated Employment Decision Tool. “Automated employment decision tool” or “AEDT” means 
“Automated employment decision tool” as defined by § 20-870 of the Code where the phrase “to 
substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making” means: 
i. 
to rely solely on a simplified output (score, tag, classification, ranking, etc.), with no other 
factors considered; or 
ii. 
 to use a simplified output as one of a set of criteria where the simplified output is weighted 
more than any other criterion in the set; or   
iii. 
to use a simplified output to overrule conclusions derived from other factors including 
human decision-making.  
  
Bias Audit. “Bias audit” means “Bias audit” as defined by § 20-870 of the Code.  
 
Candidate for Employment. “Candidate for employment” means a person who has applied for a specific 
employment position by submitting the necessary information or items in the format required by the 
employer or employment agency.  
 
Category. “Category” means any component 1 category required to be reported by employers pursuant 
to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States Code as specified in part 1602.7 of 
title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, as designated on the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission Employer Information Report EEO-1. 
 
Code. “Code” means the Administrative Code of the City of New York. 
 
Distribution Date. “Distribution date” means the date the employer or employment agency began using 
a specific AEDT.  
 
Employment Decision. “Employment decision” means “Employment decision” as defined by § 20-870 
of the Code. 
 
Employment Agency. “Employment agency” means “Employment agency” as defined by 6 RCNY § 5-
249.

The requirements, as outlined in Local Law 144 of 2021 and implemented through rules by the New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection, apply specifically to AEDTs that ""substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making"" for making employment decisions that impact natural persons. The definition of an AEDT in the rules clarifies that this means relying solely on a simplified output, using a simplified output as the most heavily weighted criterion, or using a simplified output to overrule conclusions derived from other factors including human decision-making. Therefore, if an employer or employment agency uses an AEDT that meets this definition, they must comply with the requirements for bias audits, public disclosure of audit results, and notices to employees or job candidates.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed explanation of the relationship but does not accurately reflect the ground truth definition of an automated employment decision tool or the specific legal requirements, particularly the bias audit requirement.",1.0,0.7752476930618286,4.0,"The generated answer correctly addresses the relationship between the definition of an automated employment decision tool and its requirements, providing relevant details, though it could be more concise and directly aligned with the reference answer."
"What is the relationship between test data and the requirements for a bias audit, and how do they differ?","Test data refers to the data used specifically for conducting a bias audit, which is not historical data. On the other hand, the requirements for a bias audit include calculating the selection rate and impact ratio for various categories, such as sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectional categories. While test data is a subset of the data used in a bias audit, the requirements for a bias audit involve specific calculations and analysis of different categories to identify and address biases.","Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'compare', 'seed_document_id': 18, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': [{'question': 'What is the definition of test data?', 'answer': 'Test data means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.'}, {'question': 'What are the requirements for a bias audit?', 'answer': 'A bias audit must calculate the selection rate and impact ratio for each category, including sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories.'}], 'fake_fact': None}","Test data and historical data are two types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit of an automated employment decision tool (AEDT). 

Historical data is data that has been collected from the actual use of the AEDT in the past. A bias audit conducted pursuant to the relevant law must use historical data of the AEDT, unless there is insufficient historical data available to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. 

Test data, on the other hand, is data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. An employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. However, if a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was generated and obtained.

In summary, historical data is the preferred type of data for conducting a bias audit, but test data may be used if historical data is insufficient. The requirements for a bias audit are the same regardless of the type of data used, but the summary of results must include additional information if test data is used.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed explanation of test data and historical data but does not address the specific requirements for a bias audit, such as calculating selection rates and impact ratios for various categories.

"What are the differences and similarities between 'selection rate' and 'scoring rate', and how do they relate to each other?","'Selection rate' refers to the rate at which individuals are selected or classified in a hiring process or by an AEDT, while 'scoring rate' pertains to the rate at which individuals receive a score above the sample's median score, calculated by an AEDT. Both rates involve evaluating individuals based on certain criteria, but 'selection rate' focuses on advancement in a process, while 'scoring rate' focuses on achieving a score above a threshold. In some cases, the two rates may be related, such as when a higher 'scoring rate' leads to a higher 'selection rate' for certain categories of individuals.","Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

financial interest in an employer or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to 
use the  AEDT or in a vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT. 
 
Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.

Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on

Scoring rate, on the other hand, refers to the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. It is a measure of how well individuals in a category perform on the AEDT compared to the overall sample. 

While selection rate and scoring rate are different measures, they are related in that a higher scoring rate may lead to a higher selection rate. For example, if a particular category of individuals has a higher scoring rate than other categories, they may be more likely to be selected for further consideration in the hiring process.

What calculations are required in the bias audit and when can an independent auditor exclude a category from these calculations?,"In the bias audit, calculations include determining the impact ratio for each category and assessing the impact of the AEDT on various demographic categories. An independent auditor can exclude a category from the calculations if it represents less than 2% of the data being used for the audit.","Document 16: (d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of

category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.

category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;",[],"{'question_type': 'compare', 'seed_document_id': 14, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': [{'question': 'What must be calculated in a bias audit of an AEDT?', 'answer': 'A bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category and compare the selection rates to determine an impact ratio.'}, {'question': 'What are the requirements for the published results of a bias audit?', 'answer': 'The requirements for the published results of a bias audit include providing notices to employees and candidates for employment and clarifying other obligations for the employer or employment agency.'}], 'fake_fact': None}","According to the context information provided, the calculations in a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category required to be reported to the EEOC and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to determine an impact ratio.

The requirements for the published results of the bias audit include indicating the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and including the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, in the summary of results. The summary of results must also include the independent auditor’s justification for excluding a category that represents less than 2% of the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio.

What is the relationship between the calculations required for the bias audit and the exclusion of categories from the impact ratio?,"The calculations required for the bias audit include calculating the impact ratio for each category. However, a category that represents less than 2% of the data can be excluded from these calculations.

process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.

may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the

'Scoring Rate' refers to the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. This means that the AEDT assigns a score to each individual in a category, and the scoring rate is the percentage of individuals in that category who receive a score above the median score.

'Screen', on the other hand, means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion process. This means that the AEDT is used to make a decision about whether a candidate should move forward in the hiring or promotion process based on the scores assigned by the AEDT.

Document 0: Subchapter 25: Automated Employment Decision Tools
§ 20-870 Definitions.
For the purposes of this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings:
   Automated employment decision tool. The term ""automated employment decision tool"" means any computational process, derived from machine
learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence, that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation,
that is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons. The term
""automated employment decision tool"" does not include a tool that does not automate, support, substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-
making processes and that does not materially impact natural persons, including, but not limited to, a junk email filter, firewall, antivirus software,
calculator, spreadsheet, database, data set, or other compilation of data.
   Bias audit. The term ""bias audit"" means an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor. Such bias audit shall include but not be limited to the
testing of an automated employment decision tool to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported
by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of
federal regulations.

§ 20-873 Enforcement.
The corporation counsel or such other persons designated by the corporation counsel on behalf of the department may initiate in any court of competent

Additionally, the notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees or candidates for employment must include information about the job qualifications and characteristics that the automated employment decision tool will use in the assessment of such candidate or employee. Therefore, the definition of 'employment decision' helps to clarify the scope of the requirements for using an automated employment decision tool.",False,"The agent's answer does not accurately reflect the specific definition of 'employment decision' and the legal requirement for a bias audit prior to using an automated employment decision tool, which are key elements in the ground truth.",1.0,0.9582396745681764,3.0,"The generated answer partially addresses the relationship between 'employment decision' and the requirements for using an automated tool, but it contains some inaccuracies and lacks specific details about the bias audit requirement mentioned in the reference answer."
What is the relationship between the requirements for a bias audit and the concept of test data?,"The requirements for a bias audit involve calculating selection rates for different demographic categories to determine an impact ratio. Test data, on the other hand, refers to the data used in a bias audit that is not historical data. Test data is necessary to conduct a bias audit and apply the requirements. In summary, the requirements for a bias audit rely on analyzing selection rates, while test data is the specific type of data used to perform the audit.","Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Document 6: 2 
 
 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.",[],"{'question_type': 'compare', 'seed_document_id': 5, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': [{'question': 'What are the requirements for a bias audit?', 'answer': 'A bias audit must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category and compare the selection rates to determine an impact ratio.'}, {'question': 'What is test data in the context of a bias audit?', 'answer': 'Test data is data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.'}], 'fake_fact': None}","The requirements for a bias audit specify that historical data of the AEDT must be used to conduct the audit. However, if there is insufficient historical data available to conduct a statistically significant bias audit, an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data. Test data is defined as data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. The bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was generated and obtained. Therefore, the concept of test data is a way for employers or employment agencies to conduct a bias audit when there is not enough historical data available.",False,"The agent's answer focuses on the use of test data in the context of insufficient historical data but does not address the requirement of calculating selection rates for different demographic categories, which is a key aspect of the ground truth.",1.0,0.8015053272247314,3.0,The generated answer partially addresses the relationship between bias audit requirements and test data but contains inaccuracies regarding the necessity of historical data and its role in the audit process.
What is the relationship between the purpose of a bias audit and when an employer can rely on a bias audit that uses test data?,"The purpose of a bias audit is to calculate the impact ratio for each category and ensure non-discriminatory impact. An employer can rely on a bias audit that uses test data when there is insufficient historical data available to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. In other words, the purpose of the bias audit informs the circumstances in which an employer can use test data for the audit.","Document 17: 8

these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.

1. The tool must have been the subject of a bias audit conducted no more than one year prior to the use of the tool.
2. A summary of the results of the most recent bias audit of the tool, as well as the distribution date of the tool to which such audit applies, must be made publicly available on the website of the employer prior to the use of the tool.
3. The employer must provide notice to each candidate for employment who resides in the city that an automated employment decision tool will be used in connection with the assessment or evaluation of such candidate, no less than ten business days before such use, and allow a candidate to request an alternative selection process or accommodation.

An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. Can the employer rely on a bias audit conducted using test data?,"No, the employer cannot rely on a bias audit conducted using test data. According to § 5-303, an employer may rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other employers or employment agencies, but not on a bias audit conducted using test data.","Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit. The vendor provides historical data regarding 
applicant selection that the vendor has collected from multiple employers to an independent auditor who 
will conduct a bias audit as follows:

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'rule_conclusion', 'seed_document_id': 11, 'topic': 'Metrics/Data', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","No, the employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test data.

these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'rule_conclusion', 'seed_document_id': 13, 'topic': 'Metrics/Data', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","According to Section 5-302(b) of Chapter 5 of Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York, an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.

Is this exclusion allowed under the law?,"No, the exclusion of a category that represents less than 2% of the data used for the bias audit is not allowed under the law. The law requires that all categories be included in the calculations for impact ratio, regardless of their representation in the data.","Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category.

(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'rule_conclusion', 'seed_document_id': 15, 'topic': 'Enforcement and Penalties', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","Yes, an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio.

Document 0: Subchapter 25: Automated Employment Decision Tools
§ 20-870 Definitions.
For the purposes of this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings:
   Automated employment decision tool. The term ""automated employment decision tool"" means any computational process, derived from machine
learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence, that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation,
that is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons. The term
""automated employment decision tool"" does not include a tool that does not automate, support, substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-
making processes and that does not materially impact natural persons, including, but not limited to, a junk email filter, firewall, antivirus software,
calculator, spreadsheet, database, data set, or other compilation of data.
   Bias audit. The term ""bias audit"" means an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor. Such bias audit shall include but not be limited to the
testing of an automated employment decision tool to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported

"An employer is using an AEDT to screen candidates for a job position. The AEDT assesses candidates based on 'culture fit.' According to the provided context, what are the requirements for conducting a bias audit of the AEDT?","The requirements for conducting a bias audit of the AEDT include calculating the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category, comparing the selection rates to the most selected category to determine an impact ratio, and reporting the results to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) as required by the EEO Component 1 report. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures.","Document 9: 4 
 
iii. 
at any point during the bias audit, has a direct financial interest or a material indirect 
financial interest in an employer or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to 
use the  AEDT or in a vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT. 
 
Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.  
 
 
 
    _________selection rate for a category________

OR 
 
  
 
     ______scoring rate for a category__________  
Impact Ratio =        scoring rate of the highest scoring category 
 
 
Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;",[],"{'question_type': 'rule_conclusion', 'seed_document_id': 9, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","If an employer is using an AEDT to screen candidates for a job position, they must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the planned use of the AEDT.

An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. Can the employer rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT?,"Yes, the employer can rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other employers or employment agencies.","Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'rule_conclusion', 'seed_document_id': 15, 'topic': 'Metrics/Data', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","The employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Document 6: 2 
 
 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.

New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection 
 
Notice of Adoption of Final Rule 
 
Pursuant to the authority vested in the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection by 
Sections 1043 and 2203(f) of the New York City Charter and Section 20-104(b) of the New York City 
Administrative Code, and in accordance with the requirements of Section 1043 of the New York City Charter, 
the Department amends Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York.  
 
An initial version of this rule was proposed and published on September 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on 
November 4, 2022, and comments regarding the rule were received. DCWP proposed a second version of this 
rule on December 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on January 23, 2023, and comments regarding the rule 
were received.  
 
Statement of Basis and Purpose 
 
The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP” or “Department”) is adding rules to implement 
new legislation regarding automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”). Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits 
employers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has 
been subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly 
available, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   
 
These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.

separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and

category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'vague', 'seed_document_id': 15, 'topic': 'Metrics/Data', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","The calculations required for a bias audit of an automated employment decision tool (AEDT) include:

1. Calculating the median score for the full sample of applicants.
2. Calculating the scoring rate for individuals in each category (e.g., sex, race/ethnicity).

4. Ensuring that the calculations separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race.
5. Indicating the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required calculations because they fall within an unknown category.

Additionally, an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they

The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the

“Shall” and “must” denote mandatory requirements and may be used interchangeably in the rules of this 
department, unless otherwise specified or unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.

The audit may include testing the tool using historical data or test data to determine if it disproportionately impacts certain categories of individuals, such as those based on sex, race/ethnicity, or intersectional categories.

What are the criteria for a bias audit?,"A bias audit of an AEDT must, at a minimum, calculate the selection rate for each category, calculate the impact ratio for each category, ensure that the calculations separately calculate the impact on sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories, and indicate the number of individuals not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category.","Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and

What are the criteria for an AEDT bias audit?,"A bias audit of an AEDT must, at a minimum, calculate the selection rate for each category, calculate the impact ratio for each category, ensure separate calculations for sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories, perform calculations for each group if applicable, and indicate the number of individuals not included in the calculations due to an unknown category.","Document 14: Data 
on those individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
(c) Where an AEDT scores candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion, a bias 
audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the median score for the full sample of applicants;  
(2) Calculate the scoring rate for individuals in each category;

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;",[],"{'question_type': 'vague', 'seed_document_id': 14, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","The criteria for an AEDT bias audit are outlined in several sources in the provided context information. 

According to source 5, if an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 

1. Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
2. Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
3. Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on:

5. Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 

Additionally, source 7 states that an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio.

What is the meaning of 'selection rate'?,'Selection rate' means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. It can be calculated by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.,"Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

financial interest in an employer or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to 
use the  AEDT or in a vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT. 
 
Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.  
 
 
 
    _________selection rate for a category________

Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a

What are the required calculations?,"The calculations required in the bias audit for the impact ratio include separately calculating the impact of the AEDT on sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race.","Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American

calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'vague', 'seed_document_id': 15, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","The required calculations for a bias audit of an automated employment decision tool (AEDT) are:

1. Calculate the median score for the full sample of applicants.
2. Calculate the scoring rate for individuals in each category.
3. Calculate the impact ratio for each category, which can be either the selection rate for a category divided by the selection rate of the most selected category or the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the highest scoring category.

at any point during the bias audit, has a direct financial interest or a material indirect 
financial interest in an employer or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to 
use the  AEDT or in a vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT. 
 
Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.  
 
 
 
    _________selection rate for a category________

     ______scoring rate for a category__________  
Impact Ratio =        scoring rate of the highest scoring category 
 
 
Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT;

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.","[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'I would like to know the purpose of conducting a bias audit with the AEDT.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'How can I help you with that?'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'What is its purpose?'}]","{'question_type': 'conversational', 'seed_document_id': 13, 'topic': 'Definitions', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","The purpose of conducting a bias audit with an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT) is to assess whether the tool has a disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of federal regulations. In other words, the audit is conducted to determine whether the AEDT is biased against any particular group of people based on their race, gender, age, or other protected characteristics. The audit is necessary to ensure that the AEDT is not unfairly discriminating against any group of people and to promote fairness and equal opportunity in the hiring process.",False,"The agent's answer focuses on the purpose of conducting a bias audit with an AEDT, while the ground truth specifies the function of the AEDT itself in collecting data for the audit. The answers address different aspects of the topic.",1.0,0.5115556716918945,3.0,"The generated answer provides a detailed explanation of the purpose of the AEDT in conducting a bias audit but does not explicitly mention the collection of data on race/ethnicity and gender categories, which is a key component of the reference answer."
What is the objective?,"The purpose of a bias audit for an AEDT is to calculate the selection rate and impact ratio for different categories, such as sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectional categories. It also ensures that the calculations are performed for each group if the AEDT classifies candidates into specified groups.","Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Document 6: 2 
 
 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.","[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'I need to know the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'How can I help you with that?'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'What are they?'}]","{'question_type': 'conversational', 'seed_document_id': 5, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","According to the final rules of the New York City Department of Citywide Administrative Services, a bias audit of an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT) must include, but not be limited to, the testing of the tool to assess its disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of federal regulations.

What is it called?,'Test data' refers to data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.,"Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers

may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT.

What are they?,"A bias audit of an AEDT must, at a minimum, calculate the selection rate for each category, calculate the impact ratio for each category, separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories, and indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT that are not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category.","Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Document 6: 2 
 
 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.","[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'I need to know the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'How can I help you with that?'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'What are they?'}]","{'question_type': 'conversational', 'seed_document_id': 5, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","According to the final rules of the New York City Department of Citywide Administrative Services, a bias audit of an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT) must include, but not be limited to, the testing of the tool to assess its disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of federal regulations.

What is the definition?,'Test data' refers to data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.,"Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and

Section 1.  Chapter 5 of Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York is amended to add Subchapter T to read 
as follows: 
Subchapter T: Automated Employment Decision Tools 
§ 5-300. Definitions. 
As used in this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings: 
 
Automated Employment Decision Tool. “Automated employment decision tool” or “AEDT” means 
“Automated employment decision tool” as defined by § 20-870 of the Code where the phrase “to 
substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making” means: 
i. 
to rely solely on a simplified output (score, tag, classification, ranking, etc.), with no other 
factors considered; or 
ii. 
 to use a simplified output as one of a set of criteria where the simplified output is weighted 
more than any other criterion in the set; or   
iii. 
to use a simplified output to overrule conclusions derived from other factors including 
human decision-making.  
  
Bias Audit. “Bias audit” means “Bias audit” as defined by § 20-870 of the Code.  
 
Candidate for Employment. “Candidate for employment” means a person who has applied for a specific 
employment position by submitting the necessary information or items in the format required by the 
employer or employment agency.  
 
Category. “Category” means any component 1 category required to be reported by employers pursuant 
to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States Code as specified in part 1602.7 of 
title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, as designated on the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission Employer Information Report EEO-1. 
 
Code. “Code” means the Administrative Code of the City of New York. 
 
Distribution Date. “Distribution date” means the date the employer or employment agency began using 
a specific AEDT.  
 
Employment Decision. “Employment decision” means “Employment decision” as defined by § 20-870

What should be included?,"The summary of results of a bias audit should include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios for all categories.","Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 0: Subchapter 25: Automated Employment Decision Tools
§ 20-870 Definitions.
For the purposes of this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings:
   Automated employment decision tool. The term ""automated employment decision tool"" means any computational process, derived from machine
learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence, that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation,
that is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons. The term
""automated employment decision tool"" does not include a tool that does not automate, support, substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-
making processes and that does not materially impact natural persons, including, but not limited to, a junk email filter, firewall, antivirus software,
calculator, spreadsheet, database, data set, or other compilation of data.
   Bias audit. The term ""bias audit"" means an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor. Such bias audit shall include but not be limited to the
testing of an automated employment decision tool to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported
by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of
federal regulations.
   Employment decision. The term ""employment decision"" means to screen candidates for employment or employees for promotion within the city.
(L.L. 2021/144, 12/11/2021, eff. 1/1/2023)
§ 20-871 Requirements for automated employment decision tools.
   a.   In the city, it shall be unlawful for an employer or an employment agency to use an automated employment decision tool to screen a candidate or
employee for an employment decision unless:
      1.   Such tool has been the subject of a bias audit conducted no more than one year prior to the use of such tool; and
      2.   A summary of the results of the most recent bias audit of such tool as well as the distribution date of the tool to which such audit applies has been
made publicly available on the website of the employer or employment agency prior to the use of such tool.
   b.   Notices required.","[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'I would like to know the purpose of a bias audit for automated employment decision tools.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'How can I help you with that?'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'What is the purpose?'}]","{'question_type': 'conversational', 'seed_document_id': 23, 'topic': 'Definitions', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}",The purpose of a bias audit for automated employment decision tools is to evaluate the potential for bias in the tool's algorithms and decision-making processes. The audit is conducted by an independent auditor and includes testing the tool to assess its disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of federal regulations. The goal is to ensure that the tool is not unfairly discriminating against any protected groups and to promote fairness and equity in the employment decision-making process.,False,"The agent's answer includes additional information about the goal of the audit and the role of the independent auditor, which is not part of the ground truth answer. The ground truth focuses solely on the assessment of disparate impact.",0.7142857142857143,0.4716189503669739,5.0,"The generated answer is completely correct, addressing all components of the user query accurately and providing additional relevant information without errors."
What is the meaning of it?,'Test data' refers to data used in a bias audit that is not historical data.,"Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT.

This data is typically separate from the data used to train the tool and is used to assess the accuracy and fairness of the tool's predictions or classifications. The use of test data in a bias audit can help to identify any biases or disparities in the tool's performance before it is used to make employment decisions.",False,The agent's answer provides a detailed explanation of 'test data' but does not directly address the meaning of 'it' as requested in the question.

What are the necessary details?,"A bias audit of an AEDT must, at a minimum, calculate the selection rate for each category, calculate the impact ratio for each category, separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories, and indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT that are not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category.","Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Document 6: 2 
 
 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.","[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'I need to know the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'How can I help you with that?'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'What are the necessary details?'}]","{'question_type': 'conversational', 'seed_document_id': 5, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","According to the text, the bias audit of an AEDT must include, but not be limited to, the testing of the tool to assess its disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported by employers.

New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection 
 
Notice of Adoption of Final Rule 
 
Pursuant to the authority vested in the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection by 
Sections 1043 and 2203(f) of the New York City Charter and Section 20-104(b) of the New York City 
Administrative Code, and in accordance with the requirements of Section 1043 of the New York City Charter, 
the Department amends Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York.  
 
An initial version of this rule was proposed and published on September 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on 
November 4, 2022, and comments regarding the rule were received. DCWP proposed a second version of this 
rule on December 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on January 23, 2023, and comments regarding the rule 
were received.  
 
Statement of Basis and Purpose 
 
The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP” or “Department”) is adding rules to implement 
new legislation regarding automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”). Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits 
employers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has 
been subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly 
available, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   
 
These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor's justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.",[],"{'question_type': 'out of scope', 'seed_document_id': 17, 'topic': 'Definitions', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': 'The AEDT is a software developed by a team of engineers.'}",The given context information does not provide any specific names of people who have developed the AEDT software.,True,"The agent correctly states that the context does not provide specific names of the developers of the AEDT software, which aligns with the ground truth.",1.0,0.0,5.0,"The generated answer accurately reflects the lack of specific names provided in the context, aligning perfectly with the reference answer."

using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency's data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  


The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer

ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor's justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.

 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor's justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency's data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'out of scope', 'seed_document_id': 11, 'topic': 'Enforcement and Penalties', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': 'The bias audit of the AEDT must be conducted by an external third-party company.'}",The context information does not provide the name of the person responsible for conducting the bias audit of the AEDT.,True,"The agent correctly states that the context does not provide the name of the person responsible for conducting the bias audit of the AEDT, aligning with the ground truth.",1.0,0.0,5.0,"The generated answer accurately reflects the lack of information in the context regarding the person responsible for the bias audit of the AEDT, aligning perfectly with the reference answer."

at any point during the bias audit, has a direct financial interest or a material indirect 
financial interest in an employer or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to

Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.  
 
 
 
    _________selection rate for a category________  
Impact Ratio =        selection rate of the most selected category  
 
OR 
 
  
 
     ______scoring rate for a category__________  
Impact Ratio =        scoring rate of the highest scoring category 
 
 
Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate's fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample's median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor's justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample's median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate's estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate's resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will:

to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor's justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.",[],"{'question_type': 'out of scope', 'seed_document_id': 6, 'topic': 'Definitions', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': 'The majority of the comments received were in favor of the proposed rule.'}","The context information provided does not give a specific sentiment of the comments received about the proposed rule.

these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'out of scope', 'seed_document_id': 13, 'topic': 'Metrics/Data', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': 'The average age of the male applicants in the White category is 35.'}","The given context information does not provide any information about the age of the applicants in the White category.

Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate's estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate's resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency's data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;",[],"{'question_type': 'out of scope', 'seed_document_id': 12, 'topic': 'Metrics/Data', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': 'The impact ratio for female applicants is 0.950.'}",There is no information provided in the given context about the impact ratio for non-binary applicants.,True,The agent correctly states that there is no information provided to answer the question about the impact ratio for non-binary applicants.,1.0,0.0,5.0,"The generated answer accurately reflects the lack of information regarding the impact ratio for non-binary applicants, aligning perfectly with the reference answer."

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency's data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will:
