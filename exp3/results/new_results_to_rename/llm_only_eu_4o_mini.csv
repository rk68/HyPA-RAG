These rights are often enshrined in various legal frameworks, such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Here are some key rights to consider:

1. **Right to Privacy**: AI systems that process personal data must ensure that individuals' privacy is protected. High-risk AI systems should be evaluated for their potential to infringe on this right through data collection, surveillance, or profiling.

2. **Right to Non-Discrimination**: AI systems must not perpetuate or exacerbate discrimination based on race, gender, ethnicity, religion, or other protected characteristics. Assessing the risk of biased outcomes is crucial.

3. **Right to Fair Trial**: In contexts where AI systems are used in legal proceedings (e.g., predictive policing or risk assessment tools), it is essential to ensure that these systems do not undermine the right to a fair trial.

4. **Right to Freedom of Expression**: AI systems that moderate content or influence information dissemination can impact freedom of expression. Evaluating their potential to censor or promote certain viewpoints is important.

5. **Right to Human Dignity**: AI systems that affect personal autonomy or decision-making (e.g., in healthcare or employment) must be assessed for their impact on human dignity.

6. **Right to Data Protection**: Under GDPR, individuals have rights regarding their personal data, including the right to access, rectify, and erase data. High-risk AI systems must comply with these rights.

7. **Right to Security**: AI systems that could pose risks to physical safety (e.g., autonomous vehicles, healthcare diagnostics) must be evaluated for their potential to cause harm.

8. **Right to Work**: AI systems that impact employment (e.g., automation, hiring algorithms) should be assessed for their potential to displace workers or create unfair labor practices.

9. **Right to Health**: In healthcare applications, AI systems must be evaluated for their potential to affect patient safety, treatment quality, and access to care.

10. **Right to Education**: AI systems used in educational settings should be assessed for their impact on access to quality education and the potential for bias in educational outcomes.

(22)
In light of their digital nature, certain AI systems should fall within the scope of this 
Regulation even when they are not placed on the market, put into service, or used in the 
Union. This is the case, for example, where an operator established in the Union contracts 
certain services to an operator established in a third country in relation to an activity to be 
performed by an AI system that would qualify as high-risk ▌ . In those circumstances, the 
AI system used in a third country by the operator could process data lawfully collected in 
and transferred from the Union, and provide to the contracting operator in the Union the 
output of that AI system resulting from that processing, without that AI system being 
placed on the market, put into service or used in the Union. To prevent the circumvention 
of this Regulation and to ensure an effective protection of natural persons located in the

▌ AI systems ▌ can be easily deployed in a large variety of sectors of the economy and 
many parts of society, including across borders, and can easily circulate throughout the 
Union. Certain Member States have already explored the adoption of national rules to 
ensure that AI is trustworthy and safe and is developed and used in accordance with 
fundamental rights obligations. Diverging national rules may lead to the fragmentation of 
the internal market and may decrease legal certainty for operators that develop, import or 
use AI systems. A consistent and high level of protection throughout the Union should 
therefore be ensured in order to achieve trustworthy AI, while divergences hampering the 
free circulation, innovation, deployment and the uptake of AI systems and related 
products and services within the internal market should be prevented by laying down 
uniform obligations for operators and guaranteeing the uniform protection of overriding 
reasons of public interest and of rights of persons throughout the internal market on the 
basis of Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). To 
the extent that this Regulation contains specific rules on the protection of individuals with 
regard to the processing of personal data concerning restrictions of the use of AI systems 
for remote biometric identification for the purpose of law enforcement, of the use of AI 
systems for risk assessments of natural persons for the purpose of law enforcement and 
of the use of AI systems of biometric categorisation for the purpose of law enforcement, it 
is appropriate to base this Regulation, in so far as those specific rules are concerned, on

United in diversity
EN
(115)
Providers of general-purpose AI models with systemic risks should assess and mitigate 
possible systemic risks. If, despite efforts to identify and prevent risks related to a 
general-purpose AI model that may present systemic risks, the development or use of the 
model causes a serious incident, the general-purpose AI model provider should without 
undue delay keep track of the incident and report any relevant information and possible 
corrective measures to the Commission and national competent authorities. 
Furthermore, providers should ensure an adequate level of cybersecurity protection for 
the model and its physical infrastructure, if appropriate, along the entire model lifecycle. 
Cybersecurity protection related to systemic risks associated with malicious use or 
attacks should duly consider accidental model leakage, unauthorised releases, 
circumvention of safety measures, and defence against cyberattacks, unauthorised 
access or model theft. That protection could be facilitated by securing model weights, 
algorithms, servers, and data sets, such as through operational security measures for 
information security, specific cybersecurity policies, adequate technical and established 
solutions, and cyber and physical access controls, appropriate to the relevant 
circumstances and the risks involved.

If the Commission becomes aware of the fact that a general-purpose AI model meets the 
requirements to classify as a general-purpose AI model with systemic risk, which 
previously had either not been known or of which the relevant provider has failed to 
notify the Commission, the Commission should be empowered to designate it so. A 
system of qualified alerts should ensure that the AI Office is made aware by the 
scientific panel of general-purpose AI models that should possibly be classified as 
general-purpose AI models with systemic risk, in addition to the monitoring activities of 
the AI Office.

The providers of general-purpose AI models presenting systemic risks should be subject, 
in addition to the obligations provided for providers of general-purpose AI models, to 
obligations aimed at identifying and mitigating those risks and ensuring an adequate 
level of cybersecurity protection, regardless of whether it is provided as a standalone 
model or embedded in an AI system or a product. To achieve those objectives, this 
Regulation should require providers to perform the necessary model evaluations, in 
particular prior to its first placing on the market, including conducting and documenting 
adversarial testing of models, also, as appropriate, through internal or independent 
external testing. In addition, providers of general-purpose AI models with systemic risks 
should continuously assess and mitigate systemic risks, including for example by putting 
in place risk-management policies, such as accountability and governance processes, 
implementing post-market monitoring, taking appropriate measures along the entire 
model’s lifecycle and cooperating with relevant actors along the AI value chain.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex', 'seed_document_id': 115, 'topic': 'Systemic Risks in AI'}","In the event of a serious incident involving general-purpose AI models, providers should take the following specific actions immediately:

It is appropriate that, in order to minimise the burden on operators and avoid any possible 
duplication, for high-risk AI systems related to products which are covered by existing 
Union harmonisation legislation based on the New Legislative Framework, the compliance 
of those AI systems with the requirements of this Regulation should be assessed as part of 
the conformity assessment already provided for in that law. The applicability of the 
requirements of this Regulation should thus not affect the specific logic, methodology or 
general structure of conformity assessment under the relevant Union harmonisation 
legislation. ▌

Given the complexity of high-risk AI systems and the risks that are associated with them, 
it is important to develop an adequate conformity assessment procedure for high-risk AI 
systems involving notified bodies, so-called third party conformity assessment. However, 
given the current experience of professional pre-market certifiers in the field of product 
safety and the different nature of risks involved, it is appropriate to limit, at least in an 
initial phase of application of this Regulation, the scope of application of third-party 
conformity assessment for high-risk AI systems other than those related to products. 
Therefore, the conformity assessment of such systems should be carried out as a general 
rule by the provider under its own responsibility, with the only exception of AI systems 
intended to be used for biometrics.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex', 'seed_document_id': 281, 'topic': 'Others'}","In the absence of harmonised standards for high-risk AI systems, providers must take several specific steps to ensure compliance, especially when the system is intended for use by governmental authorities.

In order to introduce a proportionate and effective set of binding rules for AI systems, a 
clearly defined risk-based approach should be followed. That approach should tailor the 
type and content of such rules to the intensity and scope of the risks that AI systems can 
generate. It is therefore necessary to prohibit certain unacceptable AI practices, to lay 
down requirements for high-risk AI systems and obligations for the relevant operators, and 
to lay down transparency obligations for certain AI systems.

While the risk-based approach is the basis for a proportionate and effective set of 
binding rules, it is important to recall the 2019 Ethics guidelines for trustworthy AI 
developed by the independent AI HLEG appointed by the Commission. In those 
guidelines, the AI HLEG developed seven non-binding ethical principles for AI which 
are intended to help ensure that AI is trustworthy and ethically sound. The seven 
principles include human agency and oversight; technical robustness and safety; privacy 
and data governance; transparency; diversity, non-discrimination and fairness; societal 
and environmental well-being and accountability. Without prejudice to the legally 
binding requirements of this Regulation and any other applicable Union law, those 
guidelines contribute to the design of coherent, trustworthy and human-centric AI, in 
line with the Charter and with the values on which the Union is founded. According to 
the guidelines of the AI HLEG, human agency and oversight means that AI systems are 
developed and used as a tool that serves people, respects human dignity and personal 
autonomy, and that is functioning in a way that can be appropriately controlled and 
overseen by humans.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex_situational', 'seed_document_id': 27, 'topic': 'AI Regulation and Ethics'}","To ensure compliance with the evolving regulatory landscape for AI systems, particularly in light of the ethical guidelines established in 2019, you can adopt a structured risk-based approach.

Here’s a structured approach to help you establish a compliant log retention policy:

1. **Understand Regulatory Requirements**:
   - **EU AI Act**: If you're operating in the EU, the AI Act may require you to retain logs for a minimum period to ensure accountability and traceability. While specific durations may not be explicitly stated, the principle of accountability suggests retaining logs for a reasonable time.
   - **GDPR**: Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), personal data should not be kept longer than necessary for the purposes for which it was processed. This means you need to assess the purpose of the logs and determine a retention period that aligns with that purpose.

2. **National Data Protection Laws**:
   - Review the specific data protection laws applicable in your jurisdiction. Many countries have their own regulations regarding data retention, which may specify minimum or maximum retention periods for logs.

3. **Purpose of Logs**:
   - Identify the purpose of the logs. Are they for auditing, troubleshooting, compliance, or security? The retention period should align with the purpose. For example, logs needed for compliance audits may need to be retained longer than those used for operational purposes.

4. **Risk Assessment**:
   - Conduct a risk assessment to evaluate the potential risks associated with retaining or deleting logs. High-risk AI systems may require longer retention periods to ensure that you can respond to incidents or audits effectively.

5. **Consult Legal and Compliance Teams**:
   - Engage with your legal and compliance teams to ensure that your log retention policy aligns with both regulatory requirements and best practices. They can provide insights into specific legal obligations and risks.

6. **Industry Standards**:
   - Look into industry standards and best practices for log retention in your sector. Some industries may have established guidelines that can inform your policy.

7. **Document Your Policy**:
   - Once you determine the appropriate retention period, document your log retention policy clearly. Include the rationale for the chosen duration and ensure that it is communicated to relevant stakeholders.

8. **Regular Review**:
   - Establish a process for regularly reviewing and updating your log retention policy to ensure ongoing compliance with changing regulations and business needs.

### Example Retention Periods:
- **Short-term (6 months to 1 year)**: For operational logs that are not tied to compliance or legal requirements.
- **Medium-term (1 to 3 years)**: For logs related to compliance audits or security incidents.
- **Long-term (3 years or more)**: For logs required for regulatory compliance, legal obligations, or significant incidents.

To ensure legal certainty, it is necessary to clarify that, under certain specific conditions, 
any distributor, importer, deployer or other third-party should be considered to be a 
provider of a high-risk AI system and therefore assume all the relevant obligations. This 
would be the case if that party puts its name or trademark on a high-risk AI system 
already placed on the market or put into service, without prejudice to contractual 
arrangements stipulating that the obligations are allocated otherwise. This would also be 
the case if that party makes a substantial modification to a high-risk AI system that has 
already been placed on the market or has already been put into service in a way that it 
remains a high-risk AI system in accordance with this Regulation, or if it modifies the 
intended purpose of an AI system, including a general-purpose AI system, which has not 
been classified as high-risk and has already been placed on the market or put into 
service, in a way that the AI system becomes a high-risk AI system in accordance with 
this Regulation. Those provisions should apply without prejudice to more specific 
provisions established in certain Union harmonisation legislation based on the New 
Legislative Framework, together with which this Regulation should apply. For example, 
Article 16(2) of Regulation (EU) 2017/745, establishing that certain changes should not

independently of the products referred to in points (a) and (b), that AI system shall be 
considered to be high-risk where both of the following conditions are fulfilled:
(a)

High-risk AI systems should only be placed on the Union market, put into service or used 
if they comply with certain mandatory requirements. Those requirements should ensure 
that high-risk AI systems available in the Union or whose output is otherwise used in the 
Union do not pose unacceptable risks to important Union public interests as recognised and 
protected by Union law. On the basis of the New Legislative Framework, as clarified in 
the Commission notice “The ‘Blue Guide’ on the implementation of EU product rules 
2022”20, the general rule is that more than one legal act of Union harmonisation 
legislation, such as Regulations (EU) 2017/74521 and (EU) 2017/74622 of the European 
Parliament and of the Council or Directive 2006/42/EC of the European Parliament and 
of the Council23, may be applicable to one product, since the making available or putting 
into service can take place only when the product complies with all applicable Union 
harmonisation legislation. To ensure consistency and avoid unnecessary administrative 
burdens or costs, providers of a product that contains one or more high-risk AI systems, 
to which the requirements of this Regulation and of the Union harmonisation legislation 
listed in an annex to this Regulation apply, should have flexibility with regard to 
operational decisions on how to ensure compliance of a product that contains one or 
more AI systems with all applicable requirements of the Union harmonisation legislation 
in an optimal manner. AI systems identified as high-risk should be limited to those that 
have a significant harmful impact on the health, safety and fundamental rights of persons 
in the Union and such limitation should minimise any potential restriction to international

These conditions typically include:

### Conditions Defining High-Risk AI Systems

1. **Intended Purpose**: The AI system is intended to be used in specific sectors or applications that are deemed high-risk, such as healthcare, transportation, law enforcement, and critical infrastructure.

2. **Impact on Rights and Safety**: The AI system poses a significant risk to the health, safety, or fundamental rights of individuals. This includes systems that can affect people's rights, such as biometric identification systems or those used in decision-making processes that impact employment or access to services.

3. **Complexity and Autonomy**: The system's complexity and level of autonomy may contribute to its risk profile. Systems that operate with a high degree of autonomy or that involve complex algorithms may be classified as high-risk.

4. **Data Usage**: The use of sensitive data, including personal data, can elevate the risk associated with the AI system. This includes systems that process large amounts of personal data or that rely on data that could lead to biased outcomes.

### Mandatory Requirements for High-Risk AI Systems

The EU has established several mandatory requirements for high-risk AI systems, which include:

1. **Risk Management System**: Providers must implement a risk management system to identify, assess, and mitigate risks associated with the AI system throughout its lifecycle.

2. **Data Governance and Management**: There are requirements for data quality, including ensuring that the data used to train the AI system is relevant, representative, and free from bias.

3. **Technical Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation must be maintained, detailing the design, development, and functioning of the AI system, including its intended purpose and risk assessment.

4. **Transparency and Explainability**: High-risk AI systems must be designed to ensure transparency, allowing users to understand how decisions are made. This includes providing information about the system's capabilities and limitations.

5. **Human Oversight**: There must be provisions for human oversight to ensure that the AI system's operations can be monitored and controlled by human operators.

6. **Conformity Assessment**: High-risk AI systems may be subject to conformity assessments to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements before they can be placed on the market.

7. **Post-Market Monitoring**: Providers are required to monitor the performance of the AI system after it has been deployed to ensure ongoing compliance and to address any emerging risks.

8. **Reporting Obligations**: There are obligations to report incidents and malfunctions related to the AI system to relevant authorities.

These requirements aim to ensure that high-risk AI systems are developed and used responsibly, minimizing potential harms while maximizing benefits to society.",False,"The agent's answer provides detailed conditions and requirements for high-risk AI systems but does not accurately reflect the ground truth, which emphasizes the manufacturer's accountability and the definition of a provider as one who markets or puts the system into service under their name or trademark.",0.8620689655172413,0.9298959970474244,5.0,"The generated answer comprehensively addresses all components of the user query, providing accurate definitions and mandatory requirements for high-risk AI systems in the EU without any errors."
"What is the purpose of applying the rules established by the Regulation to AI system providers, and why is it important to maintain a consistent level of protection for these systems throughout the Union?","The purpose of applying the Regulation's rules to AI system providers is to ensure a level playing field and protect individual rights across the Union, while maintaining a consistent level of protection is crucial for fostering trustworthy AI and preventing divergences that could disrupt the internal market.

In order to ensure a level playing field and an effective protection of rights and freedoms of 
individuals across the Union, the rules established by this Regulation should apply to 
providers of AI systems in a non-discriminatory manner, irrespective of whether they are 
established within the Union or in a third country, and to deployers of AI systems 
established within the Union.
(22)
In light of their digital nature, certain AI systems should fall within the scope of this 
Regulation even when they are not placed on the market, put into service, or used in the 
Union. This is the case, for example, where an operator established in the Union contracts 
certain services to an operator established in a third country in relation to an activity to be 
performed by an AI system that would qualify as high-risk ▌ . In those circumstances, the 
AI system used in a third country by the operator could process data lawfully collected in 
and transferred from the Union, and provide to the contracting operator in the Union the 
output of that AI system resulting from that processing, without that AI system being 
placed on the market, put into service or used in the Union. To prevent the circumvention 
of this Regulation and to ensure an effective protection of natural persons located in the 
Union, this Regulation should also apply to providers and deployers of AI systems that are 
established in a third country, to the extent the output produced by those systems is 
intended to be used in the Union.

▌ AI systems ▌ can be easily deployed in a large variety of sectors of the economy and 
many parts of society, including across borders, and can easily circulate throughout the 
Union. Certain Member States have already explored the adoption of national rules to 
ensure that AI is trustworthy and safe and is developed and used in accordance with 
fundamental rights obligations. Diverging national rules may lead to the fragmentation of 
the internal market and may decrease legal certainty for operators that develop, import or 
use AI systems. A consistent and high level of protection throughout the Union should 
therefore be ensured in order to achieve trustworthy AI, while divergences hampering the 
free circulation, innovation, deployment and the uptake of AI systems and related 
products and services within the internal market should be prevented by laying down 
uniform obligations for operators and guaranteeing the uniform protection of overriding 
reasons of public interest and of rights of persons throughout the internal market on the 
basis of Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). To

Regulation (EC) No 765/2008.",[],"{'question_type': 'compare', 'original_questions': [{'question': 'What is required for high-risk AI systems that are subject to other Union harmonisation legislation?', 'answer': 'A single EU declaration of conformity shall be drawn up in respect of all Union law applicable to the high-risk AI system.'}, {'question': 'Who is responsible for compliance with the requirements set out in Section 2 of the EU AI Act?', 'answer': 'The provider shall assume responsibility for compliance with the requirements set out in Section 2.'}], 'seed_document_id': 290, 'topic': 'Others'}","The relationship between the requirements for high-risk AI systems under Union harmonisation legislation and the provider's responsibility for compliance with Section 2 of the EU AI Act is integral to ensuring that AI systems are developed and deployed in a manner that is safe, ethical, and compliant with EU regulations.

### Key Points of the Relationship:

1. **Definition of High-Risk AI Systems**:
   - The EU AI Act categorizes AI systems into different risk levels, with high-risk systems subject to stricter requirements. These systems typically include those that can significantly impact safety, health, or fundamental rights.

2. **Union Harmonisation Legislation**:
   - This legislation sets out essential requirements for various products and services within the EU, ensuring they meet safety and performance standards. For high-risk AI systems, compliance with these standards is crucial.

3. **Provider's Responsibilities**:
   - Under Section 2 of the EU AI Act, providers of high-risk AI systems are required to ensure compliance with the relevant harmonisation legislation. This includes conducting risk assessments, implementing risk management systems, and ensuring transparency and accountability in AI operations.

4. **Conformity Assessment**:
   - Providers must undergo conformity assessments to demonstrate that their AI systems meet the necessary requirements outlined in both the EU AI Act and relevant harmonisation legislation. This may involve third-party evaluations or self-assessments, depending on the specific requirements.

5. **Documentation and Reporting**:
   - Providers are responsible for maintaining comprehensive documentation that demonstrates compliance with both the EU AI Act and harmonisation legislation. This includes technical documentation, risk management files, and post-market monitoring plans.

6. **Accountability and Liability**:
   - The provider's responsibility extends to ensuring that any high-risk AI system they develop or deploy does not pose undue risks to users or society. Failure to comply with these requirements can lead to legal liabilities and penalties.

7. **Continuous Monitoring and Improvement**:
   - Providers must also engage in ongoing monitoring of their AI systems to ensure continued compliance with evolving standards and regulations, reflecting the dynamic nature of AI technology.

### Conclusion:
In summary, the relationship between the requirements for high-risk AI systems under Union harmonisation legislation and the provider's responsibilities under Section 2 of the EU AI Act is one of mutual reinforcement. Providers must ensure that their high-risk AI systems comply with both sets of regulations to promote safety, accountability, and ethical use of AI technologies within the EU.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed explanation of the relationship but does not accurately capture the essence of the ground truth, which emphasizes the requirement of a single EU declaration of conformity and the provider's role in ensuring compliance with both the declaration and Section 2 of the EU AI Act.",0.7,0.899817943572998,4.0,"The generated answer comprehensively addresses the relationship between high-risk AI systems and the provider's responsibilities, covering all relevant components with only minor inaccuracies in detail."
"What actions should a provider take if their general-purpose AI model is classified as having systemic risks, and how does the Commission determine this designation?","If a provider's general-purpose AI model meets the criteria for systemic risks, they must notify the AI Office within two weeks. The Commission designates a model as having systemic risk based on its capabilities or impact reaching a specific threshold, reflecting a regulatory approach that considers both provider responsibilities and the Commission's evaluative criteria.","Document 113: EN

(112)
It is also necessary to clarify a procedure for the classification of a general-purpose AI 
model with systemic risks. A general-purpose AI model that meets the applicable 
threshold for high-impact capabilities should be presumed to be a general-purpose AI 
models with systemic risk. The provider should notify the AI Office at the latest two 
weeks after the requirements are met or it becomes known that a general-purpose AI 
model will meet the requirements that lead to the presumption. This is especially relevant 
in relation to the threshold of floating point operations because training of general-
purpose AI models takes considerable planning which includes the upfront allocation of 
compute resources and, therefore, providers of general-purpose AI models are able to 
know if their model would meet the threshold before the training is completed. In the 
context of that notification, the provider should be able to demonstrate that, because of 
its specific characteristics, a general-purpose AI model exceptionally does not present 
systemic risks, and that it thus should not be classified as a general-purpose AI model 
with systemic risks. That information is valuable for the AI Office to anticipate the 
placing on the market of general-purpose AI models with systemic risks and the 
providers can start to engage with the AI Office early on. That information is especially 
important with regard to general-purpose AI models that are planned to be released as 
open-source, given that, after the open-source model release, necessary measures to 
ensure compliance with the obligations under this Regulation may be more difficult to 
implement.

Document 111: EN

It is appropriate to establish a methodology for the classification of general-purpose AI 
models as general-purpose AI model with systemic risks. Since systemic risks result from 
particularly high capabilities, a general-purpose AI model should be considered to 
present systemic risks if it has high-impact capabilities, evaluated on the basis of 
appropriate technical tools and methodologies, or significant impact on the internal 
market due to its reach. High-impact capabilities in general-purpose AI models means 
capabilities that match or exceed the capabilities recorded in the most advanced general-
purpose AI models. The full range of capabilities in a model could be better understood 
after its placing on the market or when deployers interact with the model. According to 
the state of the art at the time of entry into force of this Regulation, the cumulative 
amount of computation used for the training of the general-purpose AI model measured 
in floating point operations is one of the relevant approximations for model capabilities. 
The cumulative amount of computation used for training includes the computation used 
across the activities and methods that are intended to enhance the capabilities of the 
model prior to deployment, such as pre-training, synthetic data generation and fine-
tuning. Therefore, an initial threshold of floating point operations should be set, which, 
if met by a general-purpose AI model, leads to a presumption that the model is a 
general-purpose AI model with systemic risks. This threshold should be adjusted over 
time to reflect technological and industrial changes, such as algorithmic improvements 
or increased hardware efficiency, and should be supplemented with benchmarks and 
indicators for model capability.

Document 112: EN
United in diversity
EN
To inform this, the AI Office should engage with the scientific community, industry, civil 
society and other experts. Thresholds, as well as tools and benchmarks for the 
assessment of high-impact capabilities, should be strong predictors of generality, its 
capabilities and associated systemic risk of general-purpose AI models, and could take 
into account the way the model will be placed on the market or the number of users it 
may affect. To complement this system, there should be a possibility for the Commission 
to take individual decisions designating a general-purpose AI model as a general-
purpose AI model with systemic risk if it is found that such model has capabilities or an 
impact equivalent to those captured by the set threshold. That decision should be taken 
on the basis of an overall assessment of the criteria for the designation of a general-
purpose AI model with systemic risk set out in an annex to this Regulation, such as 
quality or size of the training data set, number of business and end users, its input and 
output modalities, its level of autonomy and scalability, or the tools it has access to. 
Upon a reasoned request of a provider whose model has been designated as a general-
purpose AI model with systemic risk, the Commission should take the request into 
account and may decide to reassess whether the general-purpose AI model can still be 
considered to present systemic risks.

If the Commission becomes aware of the fact that a general-purpose AI model meets the 
requirements to classify as a general-purpose AI model with systemic risk, which 
previously had either not been known or of which the relevant provider has failed to 
notify the Commission, the Commission should be empowered to designate it so. A 
system of qualified alerts should ensure that the AI Office is made aware by the 
scientific panel of general-purpose AI models that should possibly be classified as 
general-purpose AI models with systemic risk, in addition to the monitoring activities of 
the AI Office.

The providers of general-purpose AI models presenting systemic risks should be subject, 
in addition to the obligations provided for providers of general-purpose AI models, to 
obligations aimed at identifying and mitigating those risks and ensuring an adequate 
level of cybersecurity protection, regardless of whether it is provided as a standalone 
model or embedded in an AI system or a product. To achieve those objectives, this 
Regulation should require providers to perform the necessary model evaluations, in 
particular prior to its first placing on the market, including conducting and documenting 
adversarial testing of models, also, as appropriate, through internal or independent 
external testing. In addition, providers of general-purpose AI models with systemic risks 
should continuously assess and mitigate systemic risks, including for example by putting 
in place risk-management policies, such as accountability and governance processes, 
implementing post-market monitoring, taking appropriate measures along the entire 
model’s lifecycle and cooperating with relevant actors along the AI value chain.",[],"{'question_type': 'compare', 'original_questions': [{'question': 'What should a provider do if their general-purpose AI model meets the requirements for classification as a model with systemic risks?', 'answer': 'The provider should notify the AI Office at the latest two weeks after the requirements are met or it becomes known that a general-purpose AI model will meet the requirements that lead to the presumption.'}, {'question': 'How does the Commission decide to designate a general-purpose AI model as one with systemic risk?', 'answer': 'The Commission may take individual decisions designating a general-purpose AI model as a general-purpose AI model with systemic risk if it is found that such model has capabilities or an impact equivalent to those captured by the set threshold.'}], 'seed_document_id': 113, 'topic': 'Systemic Risks in AI'}","If a provider's general-purpose AI model is classified as having systemic risks, they should take several key actions to address the situation:

1. **Risk Assessment and Mitigation**: Conduct a thorough risk assessment to identify specific systemic risks associated with the AI model. Develop and implement strategies to mitigate these risks, which may include refining the model, enhancing data quality, or adjusting deployment practices.

2. **Compliance with Regulations**: Ensure compliance with relevant regulations and guidelines set forth by regulatory bodies, such as the European Commission or other local authorities. This may involve adhering to specific standards for transparency, accountability, and safety.

3. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Engage with stakeholders, including users, affected communities, and regulatory bodies, to communicate the risks and the measures being taken to mitigate them. This can help build trust and ensure that concerns are addressed.

4. **Monitoring and Reporting**: Establish a robust monitoring system to continuously assess the performance and impact of the AI model. Regularly report findings to relevant authorities and stakeholders, demonstrating proactive management of systemic risks.

7. **Review and Update**: Regularly review and update the AI model and its risk management strategies in response to new information, technological advancements, and evolving regulatory frameworks.

### Determining Systemic Risk Designation

The Commission typically determines the designation of systemic risks through a combination of the following factors:

1. **Impact Assessment**: Evaluating the potential impact of the AI model on society, the economy, and public safety. This includes analyzing how widespread the use of the model is and the severity of potential negative outcomes.

2. **Use Cases**: Considering the specific use cases of the AI model, particularly in critical sectors such as healthcare, finance, or public safety, where failures could have significant consequences.

3. **Data and Algorithm Transparency**: Assessing the transparency of the data used to train the model and the algorithms employed, including their explainability and fairness.

4. **Historical Precedents**: Reviewing historical incidents involving similar AI models or technologies to understand potential risks and failures.

5. **Stakeholder Input**: Gathering input from various stakeholders, including industry experts, civil society, and affected communities, to gain a comprehensive understanding of the risks involved.

6. **Regulatory Frameworks**: Applying existing regulatory frameworks and guidelines that outline criteria for systemic risks in AI, ensuring that the assessment aligns with established standards.

   - **Engagement with Regulators**: Actively participating in discussions with regulatory bodies to shape policies and standards.
   - **Sharing Best Practices**: Collaborating with other organizations to share knowledge and improve safety standards across the industry.

By adhering to these criteria and obligations, providers can help mitigate systemic risks associated with general-purpose AI models and promote a safer, more responsible AI ecosystem.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed overview of criteria and obligations for reassessing systemic risk in AI models, but it does not align with the ground truth, which specifies the need for a reasoned request with new information and emphasizes identifying and mitigating risks along with maintaining cybersecurity measures.",0.2,0.9284837245941162,4.0,"The generated answer comprehensively addresses the user query by outlining criteria for reassessing systemic risk and detailing provider obligations, with only minor deviations from the reference answer's focus on ongoing evaluation and proactive risk management."
"What are the potential adverse impacts of poorly designed high-risk AI systems used by law enforcement authorities, and how do these systems contribute to these risks?","Poorly designed high-risk AI systems, such as those used for assessing crime victim risk or evaluating evidence reliability, can result in unjust surveillance and discrimination, leading to wrongful arrests or loss of liberty. The inherent risks of these systems are amplified when they are not designed with fairness and accountability in mind, potentially exacerbating issues of bias and injustice in law enforcement.","Document 67: EN
United in diversity

(59)
Given their role and responsibility, actions by law enforcement authorities involving 
certain uses of AI systems are characterised by a significant degree of power imbalance 
and may lead to surveillance, arrest or deprivation of a natural person’s liberty as well as 
other adverse impacts on fundamental rights guaranteed in the Charter. In particular, if the 
AI system is not trained with high-quality data, does not meet adequate requirements in 
terms of its performance, its accuracy or robustness, or is not properly designed and tested 
before being put on the market or otherwise put into service, it may single out people in a 
discriminatory or otherwise incorrect or unjust manner. Furthermore, the exercise of 
important procedural fundamental rights, such as the right to an effective remedy and to a 
fair trial as well as the right of defence and the presumption of innocence, could be 
hampered, in particular, where such AI systems are not sufficiently transparent, 
explainable and documented. It is therefore appropriate to classify as high-risk, insofar as 
their use is permitted under relevant Union and national law, a number of AI systems 
intended to be used in the law enforcement context where accuracy, reliability and 
transparency is particularly important to avoid adverse impacts, retain public trust and 
ensure accountability and effective redress.

Document 68: EN
United in diversity

In view of the nature of the activities and the risks relating thereto, those high-risk AI 
systems should include in particular AI systems intended to be used by or on behalf of law 
enforcement authorities or by Union institutions, bodies, offices, or agencies in support of 
law enforcement authorities for assessing the risk of a natural person to become a victim 
of criminal offences, as polygraphs and similar tools, for the evaluation of the reliability 
of evidence in in the course of investigation or prosecution of criminal offences, and, 
insofar as not prohibited under this Regulation, for assessing the risk of a natural 
person offending or reoffending not solely on the basis of the profiling of natural persons 
or the assessment of personality traits and characteristics or the past criminal behaviour of 
natural persons or groups, for profiling in the course of detection, investigation or 
prosecution of criminal offences ▌ . AI systems specifically intended to be used for 
administrative proceedings by tax and customs authorities as well as by financial 
intelligence units carrying out administrative tasks analysing information pursuant to 
Union anti-money laundering law should not be classified as high-risk AI systems used 
by law enforcement authorities for the purpose of prevention, detection, investigation and 
prosecution of criminal offences. The use of AI tools by law enforcement and other 
relevant authorities should not become a factor of inequality, or exclusion. The impact 
of the use of AI tools on the defence rights of suspects should not be ignored, in

natural persons under investigation.",[],"{'question_type': 'compare', 'original_questions': [{'question': 'What are the potential adverse impacts of poorly designed AI systems used by law enforcement authorities?', 'answer': 'Poorly designed AI systems may lead to surveillance, arrest, or deprivation of a natural person’s liberty, and can single out people in a discriminatory or unjust manner.'}, {'question': 'What types of AI systems are classified as high-risk in the law enforcement context?', 'answer': 'High-risk AI systems include those intended to be used by law enforcement for assessing the risk of a person becoming a victim of crimes, evaluating the reliability of evidence, and profiling in the course of investigations.'}], 'seed_document_id': 67, 'topic': 'AI Regulation and Ethics'}","Poorly designed high-risk AI systems used by law enforcement authorities can have several adverse impacts, which can be categorized into various domains:

### 1. **Bias and Discrimination**
- **Racial and Socioeconomic Bias**: AI systems trained on historical data may perpetuate existing biases, leading to disproportionate targeting of certain racial or socioeconomic groups.
- **False Positives/Negatives**: Misidentification can result in innocent individuals being flagged as suspects or actual offenders being overlooked, exacerbating systemic inequalities.

### 2. **Erosion of Privacy**
- **Surveillance Overreach**: AI systems can enable mass surveillance, infringing on individual privacy rights and leading to a chilling effect on free expression and assembly.
- **Data Misuse**: The collection and storage of personal data can lead to unauthorized access or misuse, further compromising individual privacy.

### 3. **Lack of Accountability and Transparency**
- **Opaque Decision-Making**: Many AI systems operate as ""black boxes,"" making it difficult to understand how decisions are made, which can hinder accountability.
- **Difficulty in Redress**: Victims of wrongful actions based on AI decisions may find it challenging to seek justice or rectify errors due to the lack of transparency.

### 4. **Reliance on Technology Over Human Judgment**
- **Decreased Human Oversight**: Over-reliance on AI can lead to diminished critical thinking and judgment by law enforcement personnel, potentially resulting in poor decision-making.
- **Automation of Discrimination**: Automated systems may reinforce discriminatory practices without human intervention, leading to systemic issues.

### 5. **Public Trust Erosion**
- **Loss of Community Trust**: The use of biased or opaque AI systems can erode public trust in law enforcement, making communities less likely to cooperate with authorities.
- **Fear of Misuse**: Concerns about how AI might be used can lead to public backlash and resistance against law enforcement initiatives.

### 6. **Legal and Ethical Implications**
- **Violation of Rights**: Poorly designed systems may violate civil liberties, leading to legal challenges and potential liabilities for law enforcement agencies.
- **Ethical Dilemmas**: The deployment of AI in sensitive areas raises ethical questions about the balance between security and individual rights.

### 7. **Operational Inefficiencies**
- **Resource Misallocation**: AI systems that are not accurately designed can lead to misallocation of resources, focusing efforts on low-risk individuals or areas instead of genuine threats.
- **Increased Workload**: Officers may face increased workloads due to the need to review and correct AI-generated outputs, detracting from their core responsibilities.

### 8. **Escalation of Violence**
- **Aggressive Policing**: AI systems that predict crime hotspots may lead to increased police presence in certain areas, potentially escalating tensions and leading to confrontations.
- **Use of Force**: Misguided AI recommendations may result in inappropriate use of force, endangering both officers and civilians.

They serve distinct but complementary purposes in regulating the entry of third-country nationals into the Schengen Area.

### Entry/Exit System (EES)

**Purpose:**
1. **Automated Border Control:** The EES is designed to record the entry and exit of third-country nationals at the external borders of the Schengen Area. It captures data such as the date and time of entry and exit, biometric data (like fingerprints and facial images), and passport information.
2. **Enhanced Security:** By maintaining a comprehensive database of entries and exits, the EES helps authorities monitor the duration of stays and identify individuals who overstay their visas or are involved in illegal activities.
3. **Facilitation of Border Checks:** The system streamlines border control processes, allowing for quicker and more efficient checks at border crossings.

### European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS)

**Purpose:**
1. **Pre-Travel Screening:** ETIAS is a pre-travel authorization system that requires third-country nationals from visa-exempt countries to apply for travel authorization before entering the Schengen Area. This involves providing personal information, travel plans, and answering security-related questions.
2. **Risk Assessment:** ETIAS assesses the risk posed by travelers based on their information and cross-references it with various security databases. This helps identify potential security threats before they reach the border.
3. **Improved Border Management:** By filtering travelers before they arrive, ETIAS aims to reduce the burden on border control authorities and enhance overall security.

### Complementary Functions

1. **Layered Security Approach:** ETIAS acts as a first line of defense by screening travelers before they arrive, while the EES provides ongoing monitoring of their movements once they are in the Schengen Area. Together, they create a comprehensive security framework.
2. **Data Integration:** Both systems are interconnected, allowing for the sharing of information. For instance, if a traveler is flagged by ETIAS, border authorities can take appropriate action when that individual attempts to enter through the EES.
3. **Efficient Management of Migration Flows:** By combining pre-travel assessments with real-time entry/exit data, the EU can better manage migration flows, ensuring that those who pose a risk are identified and dealt with appropriately.

In summary, the EES and ETIAS work together to enhance border security, streamline entry processes, and ensure that third-country nationals are monitored effectively throughout their stay in the Schengen Area.",True,,0.55,0.611932098865509,5.0,"The generated answer accurately addresses all components of the user query, providing detailed and correct information about the purposes of EES and ETIAS, as well as their complementary functions in managing third-country nationals at the borders."

objective evidence or clear indications presented to it, that the use of the ‘real-time’ remote 
biometric identification system concerned is necessary for, and proportionate to, achieving 
one of the objectives specified in paragraph 1, first subparagraph, point (h), as identified in 
the request and, in particular, remains limited to what is strictly necessary concerning 
the period of time as well as the geographic and personal scope. In deciding on the

Each use of a ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification system in publicly accessible 
spaces for the purpose of law enforcement should be subject to an express and specific 
authorisation by a judicial authority or by an independent administrative authority of a 
Member State whose decision is binding. Such authorisation should, in principle, be 
obtained prior to the use of the AI system with a view to identifying a person or persons. 
Exceptions to that rule should be allowed in duly justified situations on grounds of 
urgency, namely in situations where the need to use the systems concerned is such as to 
make it effectively and objectively impossible to obtain an authorisation before 
commencing the use of the AI system. In such situations of urgency, the use of the AI 
system should be restricted to the absolute minimum necessary and should be subject to 
appropriate safeguards and conditions, as determined in national law and specified in the 
context of each individual urgent use case by the law enforcement authority itself. In 
addition, the law enforcement authority should in such situations request such 
authorisation ▌ while providing the reasons for not having been able to request it earlier, 
without undue delay and at the latest within 24 hours. If such an authorisation is 
rejected, the use of real-time biometric identification systems linked to that authorisation 
should cease with immediate effect and all the data related to such use should be 
discarded and deleted. Such data includes input data directly acquired by an AI system 
in the course of the use of such system as well as the results and outputs of the use 
linked to that authorisation. It should not include input that is legally acquired in 
accordance with another Union or national law. In any case, no decision producing an 
adverse legal effect on a person should be taken based solely on the output of the remote 
biometric identification system.

account the following elements:
(a)
the nature of the situation giving rise to the possible use, in particular the seriousness, 
probability and scale of the harm that would be caused if the system were not used;
(b)
the consequences of the use of the system for the rights and freedoms of all persons 
concerned, in particular the seriousness, probability and scale of those consequences.
In addition, the use of ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification systems in publicly 
accessible spaces for the purposes of law enforcement for any of the objectives referred to 
in paragraph 1, first subparagraph, point (h), of this Article shall comply with necessary 
and proportionate safeguards and conditions in relation to the use in accordance with the 
national law authorising the use thereof, in particular as regards the temporal, geographic 
and personal limitations. The use of the ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification system 
in publicly accessible spaces shall be authorised only if the law enforcement authority 
has completed a fundamental rights impact assessment as provided for in Article 27 and 
has registered the system in the EU database according to Article 49. However, in duly 
justified cases of urgency, the use of such systems may be commenced without the 
registration in the EU database, provided that such registration is completed without 
undue delay.

### Requirements:

1. **Legal Framework**: There must be a clear legal basis for the use of biometric identification, often outlined in national or regional laws. This includes compliance with data protection regulations.

2. **Authorization**: Law enforcement agencies typically need to obtain specific authorization or a warrant to deploy such systems, especially for real-time surveillance.

3. **Purpose Limitation**: The use of biometric data must be limited to specific, legitimate purposes, such as preventing or investigating serious crimes.

4. **Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)**: Agencies may be required to conduct a DPIA to assess the potential impact on individuals' privacy and rights.

5. **Transparency**: There may be requirements for public transparency, including informing the public about the use of such systems and their purposes.

6. **Accountability and Oversight**: There should be mechanisms for oversight, including independent reviews or audits to ensure compliance with laws and regulations.

7. **Data Security**: Strict measures must be in place to protect the biometric data collected, including encryption and access controls.

8. **Retention Policies**: Clear policies on how long biometric data will be retained and when it will be deleted.

### Consequences of Rejected Authorization:

1. **Legal Consequences**: If authorization is rejected, law enforcement may not be able to use the biometric identification system, which could hinder investigations or operations.

2. **Operational Limitations**: Agencies may need to rely on alternative methods for identification and surveillance, which could be less effective.

3. **Accountability Issues**: Rejection may lead to scrutiny of the agency's practices and policies, potentially resulting in reforms or changes in procedures.

4. **Public Trust**: Repeated rejections or controversies surrounding the use of biometric systems can erode public trust in law enforcement.

5. **Potential for Legal Challenges**: If law enforcement proceeds without proper authorization, it could lead to legal challenges, including lawsuits for violation of privacy rights.

6. **Policy Revisions**: Agencies may need to revise their policies or seek new legislative measures to align with public and legal expectations.

### Quality Management System (QMS)

1. **Documentation**: Providers must maintain comprehensive documentation of the QMS, including policies, procedures, and records that demonstrate compliance with regulatory requirements.

2. **Risk Management**: A systematic approach to identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks associated with the AI system throughout its lifecycle is essential. This includes risk assessment methodologies and documentation of risk management activities.

3. **Design and Development Controls**: The QMS should include controls for the design and development phases, ensuring that the AI system meets specified requirements and is validated against intended use.

4. **Testing and Validation**: Providers must implement processes for testing and validating the AI system to ensure it performs as intended and meets safety and performance standards.

5. **Change Management**: Procedures for managing changes to the AI system, including updates and modifications, should be established to ensure ongoing compliance and performance.

6. **Training and Competence**: Ensuring that personnel involved in the development, deployment, and monitoring of the AI system are adequately trained and competent.

7. **Internal Audits**: Regular internal audits of the QMS should be conducted to assess compliance and identify areas for improvement.

### Post-Market Monitoring System

1. **Monitoring and Reporting**: Providers must establish a system for ongoing monitoring of the AI system's performance in the market, including mechanisms for collecting data on its use and any incidents or malfunctions.

2. **User Feedback**: Implementing processes to gather and analyze user feedback to identify potential issues and areas for improvement.

3. **Incident Reporting**: A clear procedure for reporting incidents, including adverse events or failures, to relevant authorities and stakeholders.

4. **Data Analysis**: Continuous analysis of data collected from the AI system in operation to identify trends, risks, and opportunities for enhancement.

5. **Corrective Actions**: Procedures for taking corrective actions in response to identified issues, including updates to the AI system or changes to operational practices.

6. **Periodic Review**: Regular reviews of the post-market monitoring system to ensure its effectiveness and to adapt to new risks or changes in the operational environment.

"What are the conditions that classify an AI system as high-risk, and under what circumstances is a product manufacturer considered the provider of such a system?","An AI system is classified as high-risk if it serves as a safety component of a product that requires third-party conformity assessment under Union harmonisation legislation. A product manufacturer is considered the provider of a high-risk AI system if it is marketed under their name or trademark, either alongside the product or after the product's market introduction, indicating a direct relationship between the manufacturer and the high-risk classification of the AI system.","Document 247: EN

3.
In the case of high-risk AI systems that are safety components of products covered by the 
Union harmonisation legislation listed in Section A of Annex I, the product manufacturer 
shall be considered to be the provider of the high-risk AI system, and shall be subject to 
the obligations under Article 16 under either of the following circumstances:
(a)
the high-risk AI system is placed on the market together with the product under the 
name or trademark of the product manufacturer;
(b)
the high-risk AI system is put into service under the name or trademark of the 
product manufacturer after the product has been placed on the market.
4.
The provider of a high-risk AI system and the third party that supplies an AI system, 
tools, services, components, or processes that are used or integrated in a high-risk AI 
system shall, by written agreement, specify the necessary information, capabilities, 
technical access and other assistance based on the generally acknowledged state of the 
art, in order to enable the provider of the high-risk AI system to fully comply with the 
obligations set out in this Regulation. This paragraph shall not apply to third parties 
making accessible to the public tools, services, processes, or components, other than

To ensure legal certainty, it is necessary to clarify that, under certain specific conditions, 
any distributor, importer, deployer or other third-party should be considered to be a 
provider of a high-risk AI system and therefore assume all the relevant obligations. This 
would be the case if that party puts its name or trademark on a high-risk AI system 
already placed on the market or put into service, without prejudice to contractual 
arrangements stipulating that the obligations are allocated otherwise. This would also be 
the case if that party makes a substantial modification to a high-risk AI system that has 
already been placed on the market or has already been put into service in a way that it 
remains a high-risk AI system in accordance with this Regulation, or if it modifies the 
intended purpose of an AI system, including a general-purpose AI system, which has not 
been classified as high-risk and has already been placed on the market or put into 
service, in a way that the AI system becomes a high-risk AI system in accordance with 
this Regulation. Those provisions should apply without prejudice to more specific 
provisions established in certain Union harmonisation legislation based on the New 
Legislative Framework, together with which this Regulation should apply. For example, 
Article 16(2) of Regulation (EU) 2017/745, establishing that certain changes should not 
be considered to be modifications of a device that could affect its compliance with the 
applicable requirements, should continue to apply to high-risk AI systems that are

Classification rules for high-risk AI systems
1.
Irrespective of whether an AI system is placed on the market or put into service 
independently of the products referred to in points (a) and (b), that AI system shall be 
considered to be high-risk where both of the following conditions are fulfilled:
(a)
the AI system is intended to be used as a safety component of a product, or the AI 
system is itself a product, covered by the Union harmonisation legislation listed in 
Annex I;
(b)
the product whose safety component pursuant to point (a) is the AI system, or the 
AI system itself as a product, is required to undergo a third-party conformity 
assessment, with a view to the placing on the market or the putting into service of 
that product pursuant to the Union harmonisation legislation listed in Annex I.

Document 46: EN
United in diversity
EN
(46)
High-risk AI systems should only be placed on the Union market, put into service or used 
if they comply with certain mandatory requirements. Those requirements should ensure 
that high-risk AI systems available in the Union or whose output is otherwise used in the 
Union do not pose unacceptable risks to important Union public interests as recognised and 
protected by Union law. On the basis of the New Legislative Framework, as clarified in 
the Commission notice “The ‘Blue Guide’ on the implementation of EU product rules 
2022”20, the general rule is that more than one legal act of Union harmonisation 
legislation, such as Regulations (EU) 2017/74521 and (EU) 2017/74622 of the European 
Parliament and of the Council or Directive 2006/42/EC of the European Parliament and 
of the Council23, may be applicable to one product, since the making available or putting 
into service can take place only when the product complies with all applicable Union 
harmonisation legislation. To ensure consistency and avoid unnecessary administrative 
burdens or costs, providers of a product that contains one or more high-risk AI systems, 
to which the requirements of this Regulation and of the Union harmonisation legislation 
listed in an annex to this Regulation apply, should have flexibility with regard to 
operational decisions on how to ensure compliance of a product that contains one or 
more AI systems with all applicable requirements of the Union harmonisation legislation 
in an optimal manner. AI systems identified as high-risk should be limited to those that 
have a significant harmful impact on the health, safety and fundamental rights of persons 
in the Union and such limitation should minimise any potential restriction to international 
trade.

### Conditions for High-Risk AI Systems

1. **Impact on Fundamental Rights**: If the AI system significantly affects individuals' rights and freedoms, such as privacy, non-discrimination, or access to essential services.

2. **Safety and Security**: Systems that could pose risks to health, safety, or security, particularly in critical sectors like healthcare, transportation, or public safety.

3. **Complexity and Autonomy**: AI systems that operate with a high degree of autonomy or complexity, making their decision-making processes difficult to interpret or predict.

4. **Use in Critical Infrastructure**: AI applications used in critical infrastructure sectors (e.g., energy, water supply, transportation) that could lead to significant disruptions or hazards.

5. **Vulnerability to Manipulation**: Systems that could be easily manipulated or misused, leading to harmful outcomes.

6. **Data Sensitivity**: Use of sensitive personal data, especially in contexts like biometric identification or profiling.

7. **Scale of Deployment**: The potential for widespread impact due to the scale at which the AI system is deployed.

### Circumstances for Manufacturer Classification

A product manufacturer may be considered the provider of a high-risk AI system under the following circumstances:

1. **Design and Development**: If the manufacturer is responsible for the design, development, and deployment of the AI system, they are typically classified as the provider.

2. **Control Over Functionality**: If the manufacturer retains control over the AI system's functionality, including updates and maintenance, they are likely considered the provider.

3. **Integration into Products**: If the AI system is integrated into a product or service that the manufacturer sells, they may be classified as the provider, especially if the AI is a core component of the product's functionality.

4. **Liability and Accountability**: If the manufacturer is liable for the AI system's performance and outcomes, they are often recognized as the provider.

5. **Regulatory Compliance**: If the manufacturer is required to comply with specific regulations governing high-risk AI systems, this may further solidify their status as the provider.

6. **Partnerships and Collaborations**: In cases where multiple entities are involved, the manufacturer may still be considered the provider if they play a significant role in the system's development or deployment.

### Conclusion

The classification of an AI system as high-risk and the designation of a product manufacturer as its provider depend on a combination of the system's impact, functionality, and the manufacturer's role in its lifecycle. Regulatory frameworks, such as the EU's AI Act, provide specific guidelines to help determine these classifications.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed explanation of conditions for high-risk AI systems and circumstances for manufacturer classification, but it does not accurately reflect the specific criteria outlined in the ground truth, particularly regarding the safety component and the marketing relationship.",0.4583333333333333,0.8944759368896484,4.0,"The generated answer comprehensively addresses the conditions for classifying an AI system as high-risk and the circumstances under which a product manufacturer is considered the provider, with only minor deviations from the reference answer."

In contrast, the Commission's role in assessing the enforcement of the Regulation seven years after its entry into force is more about evaluating the effectiveness and implementation of the regulatory framework itself. This assessment involves analyzing how well the regulation has been enforced, identifying any gaps or challenges in compliance, and determining whether the intended outcomes of the regulation have been achieved. The Commission's evaluation may lead to recommendations for amendments or improvements to the regulation based on its findings.

unnecessary costs, providers of a product that contains one or more high-risk AI system, 
to which the requirements of this Regulation and of the Union harmonisation legislation 
based on the New Legislative Framework and listed in an annex to this Regulation 
apply, should have flexibility with regard to operational decisions on how to ensure 
compliance of a product that contains one or more AI systems with all the applicable 
requirements of that Union harmonised legislation in an optimal manner. That 
flexibility could mean, for example a decision by the provider to integrate a part of the 
necessary testing and reporting processes, information and documentation required 
under this Regulation into already existing documentation and procedures required 
under existing Union harmonisation legislation based on the New Legislative 
Framework and listed in an annex to this Regulation. This should not, in any way,

In order to ensure that providers of high-risk AI systems can take into account the 
experience on the use of high-risk AI systems for improving their systems and the design 
and development process or can take any possible corrective action in a timely manner, all 
providers should have a post-market monitoring system in place. Where relevant, post-
market monitoring should include an analysis of the interaction with other AI systems 
including other devices and software. Post-market monitoring should not cover sensitive 
operational data of deployers which are law enforcement authorities. This system is also 
key to ensure that the possible risks emerging from AI systems which continue to ‘learn’ 
after being placed on the market or put into service can be more efficiently and timely 
addressed. In this context, providers should also be required to have a system in place to 
report to the relevant authorities any serious incidents resulting from the use of their AI 
systems, meaning incident or malfunctioning leading to death or serious damage to 
health, serious and irreversible disruption of the management and operation of critical

2. **Feedback Mechanisms**:
   - **In-App Feedback**: Integrate tools for users to provide feedback directly within the application.
   - **Surveys and Interviews**: Conduct periodic surveys and interviews to gather qualitative and quantitative data on user experience.

3. **Transparency and Explainability**:
   - **Clear Communication**: Provide users with clear information about how the AI system works, its limitations, and the rationale behind its decisions.
   - **Explainable AI**: Implement features that allow users to understand the reasoning behind AI outputs.

4. **Continuous Monitoring and Evaluation**:
   - **Performance Metrics**: Establish key performance indicators (KPIs) to monitor system performance and user satisfaction.
   - **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular audits to assess the system's impact and identify areas for improvement.

5. **Iterative Development**:
   - **Agile Methodologies**: Use agile development practices to allow for rapid iterations based on user feedback.
   - **Version Updates**: Regularly release updates that incorporate user feedback and improve functionality.

6. **Training and Support**:
   - **User Training**: Provide comprehensive training resources to help users understand and effectively use the system.
   - **Support Channels**: Establish robust support channels (e.g., chat, email, forums) for users to seek help and share experiences.

7. **Ethical Considerations**:
   - **Bias Mitigation**: Implement strategies to identify and mitigate biases in AI algorithms that could affect user experience.
   - **Privacy Protections**: Ensure that user data is handled ethically and in compliance with privacy regulations.

   - **Comprehensive Documentation**: Provide detailed documentation that covers system features, troubleshooting, and best practices.
   - **Resource Libraries**: Create resource libraries with tutorials, FAQs, and case studies to enhance user understanding.

10. **Regulatory Compliance**:
    - **Adherence to Standards**: Stay updated on relevant regulations and standards for high-risk AI systems to ensure compliance and build user trust.

What is the purpose of establishing uniform obligations for operators of AI systems within the EU?,"The purpose is to ensure a consistent and high level of protection throughout the Union, achieve trustworthy AI, and prevent divergences that may hamper the free circulation, innovation, deployment, and uptake of AI systems and related products and services within the internal market.","Document 3: EN

▌ AI systems ▌ can be easily deployed in a large variety of sectors of the economy and 
many parts of society, including across borders, and can easily circulate throughout the 
Union. Certain Member States have already explored the adoption of national rules to 
ensure that AI is trustworthy and safe and is developed and used in accordance with 
fundamental rights obligations. Diverging national rules may lead to the fragmentation of 
the internal market and may decrease legal certainty for operators that develop, import or 
use AI systems. A consistent and high level of protection throughout the Union should 
therefore be ensured in order to achieve trustworthy AI, while divergences hampering the 
free circulation, innovation, deployment and the uptake of AI systems and related 
products and services within the internal market should be prevented by laying down 
uniform obligations for operators and guaranteeing the uniform protection of overriding 
reasons of public interest and of rights of persons throughout the internal market on the 
basis of Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). To 
the extent that this Regulation contains specific rules on the protection of individuals with 
regard to the processing of personal data concerning restrictions of the use of AI systems 
for remote biometric identification for the purpose of law enforcement, of the use of AI 
systems for risk assessments of natural persons for the purpose of law enforcement and 
of the use of AI systems of biometric categorisation for the purpose of law enforcement, it 
is appropriate to base this Regulation, in so far as those specific rules are concerned, on 
Article 16 TFEU. In light of those specific rules and the recourse to Article 16 TFEU, it is 
appropriate to consult the European Data Protection Board.

What should a provider do if their general-purpose AI model meets the threshold for high-impact capabilities?,The provider should notify the AI Office at the latest two weeks after the requirements are met or it becomes known that a general-purpose AI model will meet the requirements that lead to the presumption.,"Document 111: EN
United in diversity
EN
(111)
It is appropriate to establish a methodology for the classification of general-purpose AI 
models as general-purpose AI model with systemic risks. Since systemic risks result from 
particularly high capabilities, a general-purpose AI model should be considered to 
present systemic risks if it has high-impact capabilities, evaluated on the basis of 
appropriate technical tools and methodologies, or significant impact on the internal 
market due to its reach. High-impact capabilities in general-purpose AI models means 
capabilities that match or exceed the capabilities recorded in the most advanced general-
purpose AI models. The full range of capabilities in a model could be better understood 
after its placing on the market or when deployers interact with the model. According to 
the state of the art at the time of entry into force of this Regulation, the cumulative 
amount of computation used for the training of the general-purpose AI model measured 
in floating point operations is one of the relevant approximations for model capabilities. 
The cumulative amount of computation used for training includes the computation used 
across the activities and methods that are intended to enhance the capabilities of the 
model prior to deployment, such as pre-training, synthetic data generation and fine-
tuning. Therefore, an initial threshold of floating point operations should be set, which, 
if met by a general-purpose AI model, leads to a presumption that the model is a 
general-purpose AI model with systemic risks. This threshold should be adjusted over 
time to reflect technological and industrial changes, such as algorithmic improvements 
or increased hardware efficiency, and should be supplemented with benchmarks and 
indicators for model capability.

Document 113: EN
United in diversity
EN
(112)
It is also necessary to clarify a procedure for the classification of a general-purpose AI 
model with systemic risks. A general-purpose AI model that meets the applicable 
threshold for high-impact capabilities should be presumed to be a general-purpose AI 
models with systemic risk. The provider should notify the AI Office at the latest two 
weeks after the requirements are met or it becomes known that a general-purpose AI 
model will meet the requirements that lead to the presumption. This is especially relevant 
in relation to the threshold of floating point operations because training of general-
purpose AI models takes considerable planning which includes the upfront allocation of 
compute resources and, therefore, providers of general-purpose AI models are able to 
know if their model would meet the threshold before the training is completed. In the 
context of that notification, the provider should be able to demonstrate that, because of 
its specific characteristics, a general-purpose AI model exceptionally does not present 
systemic risks, and that it thus should not be classified as a general-purpose AI model 
with systemic risks. That information is valuable for the AI Office to anticipate the 
placing on the market of general-purpose AI models with systemic risks and the 
providers can start to engage with the AI Office early on. That information is especially 
important with regard to general-purpose AI models that are planned to be released as 
open-source, given that, after the open-source model release, necessary measures to 
ensure compliance with the obligations under this Regulation may be more difficult to 
implement.

Document 112: EN
United in diversity
EN
To inform this, the AI Office should engage with the scientific community, industry, civil 
society and other experts. Thresholds, as well as tools and benchmarks for the 
assessment of high-impact capabilities, should be strong predictors of generality, its 
capabilities and associated systemic risk of general-purpose AI models, and could take 
into account the way the model will be placed on the market or the number of users it 
may affect. To complement this system, there should be a possibility for the Commission 
to take individual decisions designating a general-purpose AI model as a general-
purpose AI model with systemic risk if it is found that such model has capabilities or an 
impact equivalent to those captured by the set threshold. That decision should be taken 
on the basis of an overall assessment of the criteria for the designation of a general-
purpose AI model with systemic risk set out in an annex to this Regulation, such as 
quality or size of the training data set, number of business and end users, its input and 
output modalities, its level of autonomy and scalability, or the tools it has access to. 
Upon a reasoned request of a provider whose model has been designated as a general-
purpose AI model with systemic risk, the Commission should take the request into 
account and may decide to reassess whether the general-purpose AI model can still be 
considered to present systemic risks.",[],"{'question_type': 'simple', 'seed_document_id': 111, 'topic': 'Systemic Risks in AI'}","If a provider determines that their general-purpose AI model meets the threshold for high-impact capabilities, they should take several important steps to ensure responsible and ethical use of the technology:

1. **Risk Assessment**: Conduct a thorough risk assessment to identify potential harms, biases, and misuse scenarios associated with the AI model. This should include evaluating the model's impact on individuals, communities, and society at large.

2. **Compliance with Regulations**: Ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations governing AI use, including data protection, privacy, and sector-specific guidelines. Stay updated on evolving legal frameworks.

3. **Transparency**: Provide clear documentation about the model's capabilities, limitations, and intended use cases. Transparency helps users understand the potential risks and benefits.

"Imagine a scenario where an AI system used in a children's educational app inadvertently exposes sensitive personal data, leading to significant privacy violations.

The extent of the adverse impact caused by the AI system on the fundamental rights 
protected by the Charter is of particular relevance when classifying an AI system as high 
risk. Those rights include the right to human dignity, respect for private and family life, 
protection of personal data, freedom of expression and information, freedom of 
assembly and of association, the right to non-discrimination, the right to education, 
consumer protection, workers’ rights, the rights of persons with disabilities, gender 
equality, intellectual property rights, the right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial, 
the right of defence and the presumption of innocence, and the right to good 
administration. In addition to those rights, it is important to highlight the fact that 
children have specific rights as enshrined in Article 24 of the Charter and in the United 
Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, further developed in the UNCRC 
General Comment No 25 as regards the digital environment, both of which require 
consideration of the children’s vulnerabilities and provision of such protection and care 
as necessary for their well-being. The fundamental right to a high level of environmental 
protection enshrined in the Charter and implemented in Union policies should also be 
considered when assessing the severity of the harm that an AI system can cause, 
including in relation to the health and safety of persons.",[],"{'question_type': 'rule_conclusion', 'seed_document_id': 49, 'topic': 'AI Regulation and Ethics'}","In the scenario where an AI system in a children's educational app exposes sensitive personal data, the assessment of the AI system's risk level would need to carefully balance the right to privacy and the right to an effective remedy, as outlined in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.

1. **Right to Privacy**: Article 7 of the Charter emphasizes the importance of privacy and personal data protection. Given that the app is designed for children, the sensitivity of the data involved is heightened. The exposure of such data would be a significant violation of privacy rights, particularly under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which places strict obligations on data controllers and processors regarding the handling of personal data.

2. **Right to an Effective Remedy**: Article 47 of the Charter ensures that everyone has the right to an effective remedy before a tribunal for violations of their rights. In cases of data breaches, individuals must have access to mechanisms that allow them to seek redress for the harm caused by the violation of their privacy.

In assessing the risk level of the AI system, the priority may depend on several factors:

- **Severity of the Privacy Violation**: If the exposure of personal data poses a significant risk to the affected individuals (e.g., identity theft, emotional distress), the right to privacy may take precedence in the assessment. Protecting vulnerable populations, such as children, is a critical consideration.

- **Availability of Remedies**: If effective remedies are readily available to those affected (e.g., compensation, support services), this might mitigate the impact of the privacy violation. However, if remedies are inadequate or difficult to access, the emphasis on privacy protection may be stronger.

- **Preventive Measures**: The assessment would also consider whether the AI system had adequate safeguards in place to prevent such violations. A lack of preventive measures could indicate a higher risk level, further emphasizing the need to prioritize privacy.

In conclusion, while both rights are fundamental, the specific context of the violation, the nature of the data involved, and the potential harm to individuals would likely lead to a prioritization of the right to privacy in this scenario. However, ensuring that individuals have access to effective remedies remains crucial for upholding their rights in the aftermath of such violations.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed analysis but ultimately emphasizes the right to privacy over the right to an effective remedy, which does not align with the ground truth that states both rights should be considered in the overall evaluation.",0.2272727272727272,0.766424834728241,4.0,"The generated answer effectively addresses the components of the user query, providing a thorough analysis of both the right to privacy and the right to an effective remedy, with only minor errors in emphasis."

Here's why:

1. **Dual Regulatory Framework**: The EU AI Act and medical device regulations serve different but complementary purposes. The EU AI Act specifically addresses the risks associated with AI technologies, while medical device regulations focus on the safety and efficacy of medical devices. Since the AI system is intended for use in medical devices, it falls under both frameworks.

2. **High-Risk Classification**: If the AI system is classified as high-risk under the EU AI Act, it must comply with specific requirements, including risk management, data governance, transparency, and human oversight. These requirements are designed to mitigate risks associated with AI, which is particularly important in a medical context where user safety is paramount.

3. **Enhanced Safety Measures**: Medical device regulations already impose strict safety and performance standards. However, the integration of AI introduces additional complexities and potential risks that may not be fully addressed by existing medical device regulations alone. Compliance with the EU AI Act can help ensure that these additional risks are managed effectively.

4. **Regulatory Alignment**: Adhering to both sets of regulations can facilitate a more comprehensive approach to compliance, ensuring that the AI system is safe, effective, and trustworthy. This alignment can also enhance the company's credibility and market acceptance.

5. **Future-Proofing**: The regulatory landscape for AI is evolving. By proactively complying with the EU AI Act, the company can better position itself to adapt to future regulatory changes and expectations.

2. **Conformity Assessment**: Depending on the classification of the AI system, the company may need to undergo a conformity assessment to demonstrate that the system meets the requirements set out in the EU AI Act. This may involve internal checks or third-party evaluations.

3. **Data Governance**: Ensure that the data used for training, validation, and testing the AI system complies with data protection regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This includes obtaining necessary consents and ensuring data quality and integrity.

4. **Transparency and Information Provision**: Provide clear and comprehensive information about the AI system to users and affected parties. This includes disclosing the purpose of the AI system, its capabilities, and any limitations.

5. **Human Oversight**: Implement measures for human oversight to ensure that the AI system can be monitored and controlled by human operators, especially in critical applications.

6. **Post-Market Monitoring**: Establish a system for monitoring the AI system's performance and impact after deployment. This includes mechanisms for reporting incidents and addressing any issues that arise.

7. **Documentation and Record-Keeping**: Maintain detailed documentation of the AI system's design, development, and testing processes, as well as any risk assessments and conformity assessments conducted.

The notion of general-purpose AI models should be clearly defined and set apart from 
the notion of AI systems to enable legal certainty. The definition should be based on the 
key functional characteristics of a general-purpose AI model, in particular the generality 
and the capability to competently perform a wide range of distinct tasks. These models 
are typically trained on large amounts of data, through various methods, such as self-
supervised, unsupervised or reinforcement learning. General-purpose AI models may be 
placed on the market in various ways, including through libraries, application 
programming interfaces (APIs), as direct download, or as physical copy. These models 
may be further modified or fine-tuned into new models. Although AI models are 
essential components of AI systems, they do not constitute AI systems on their own. AI 
models require the addition of further components, such as for example a user interface, 
to become AI systems. AI models are typically integrated into and form part of AI 
systems. This Regulation provides specific rules for general-purpose AI models and for 
general-purpose AI models that pose systemic risks, which should apply also when these 
models are integrated or form part of an AI system. It should be understood that the 
obligations for the providers of general-purpose AI models should apply once the 
general-purpose AI models are placed on the market.

When the provider of a general-purpose AI model integrates an own model into its own 
AI system that is made available on the market or put into service, that model should be 
considered to be placed on the market and, therefore, the obligations in this Regulation 
for models should continue to apply in addition to those for AI systems. The obligations 
laid down for models should in any case not apply when an own model is used for purely 
internal processes that are not essential for providing a product or a service to third 
parties and the rights of natural persons are not affected. Considering their potential 
significantly negative effects, the general-purpose AI models with systemic risk should 
always be subject to the relevant obligations under this Regulation. The definition

2. **Copyright and Right of Publicity**: If the historical figure is still under copyright or has a right of publicity (which varies by jurisdiction), the filmmaker may need permission to use their likeness, even in a satirical context. Historical figures may have different protections depending on their status and the laws of the relevant jurisdiction.

3. **Fair Use**: In the U.S., the doctrine of fair use may apply, particularly in the context of satire and commentary. However, fair use is a complex legal standard that considers factors like the purpose of use, the nature of the original work, the amount used, and the effect on the market for the original work.

4. **Defamation and Misrepresentation**: If the deep fake misrepresents the historical figure in a way that could harm their reputation or mislead the audience, there could be legal repercussions. Satire is often protected, but it must be clear that the work is not intended to be taken as factual.

5. **Ethical Considerations**: Beyond legal obligations, ethical considerations come into play. Filmmakers should consider the potential impact of their work on public perception and the legacy of the historical figure.

6. **Jurisdictional Variations**: Laws regarding deep fakes, copyright, and publicity rights vary significantly by country and even by state within the U.S. It's essential to consult legal experts familiar with the specific laws applicable to the project.

In summary, while there may not be a strict legal requirement to disclose the use of deep fakes in a satirical film, doing so can enhance transparency and mitigate potential legal risks. Filmmakers should carefully navigate copyright, publicity rights, and ethical considerations in their creative process.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed analysis of legal and ethical considerations but does not accurately reflect the specific requirement for disclosure as stated in the ground truth. The ground truth emphasizes that the disclosure obligation is limited to not hampering the display or enjoyment of the work, which the agent does not mention.",0.7419354838709677,0.0,3.0,"The generated answer provides relevant information and addresses multiple components of the query, but it lacks clarity on the specific disclosure requirement and includes some inaccuracies regarding legal obligations."
"If a tech company develops a large generative AI model capable of producing various forms of content and decides to place it on the market, should this model be classified as a general-purpose AI model under the Regulation, and what obligations would apply to it in this scenario?","Yes, the large generative AI model should be classified as a general-purpose AI model under the Regulation, and the obligations for general-purpose AI models would apply once it is placed on the market.","Document 101: EN
United in diversity
EN
(97)
The notion of general-purpose AI models should be clearly defined and set apart from 
the notion of AI systems to enable legal certainty. The definition should be based on the 
key functional characteristics of a general-purpose AI model, in particular the generality 
and the capability to competently perform a wide range of distinct tasks. These models 
are typically trained on large amounts of data, through various methods, such as self-
supervised, unsupervised or reinforcement learning. General-purpose AI models may be 
placed on the market in various ways, including through libraries, application 
programming interfaces (APIs), as direct download, or as physical copy. These models 
may be further modified or fine-tuned into new models. Although AI models are 
essential components of AI systems, they do not constitute AI systems on their own. AI 
models require the addition of further components, such as for example a user interface, 
to become AI systems. AI models are typically integrated into and form part of AI 
systems. This Regulation provides specific rules for general-purpose AI models and for 
general-purpose AI models that pose systemic risks, which should apply also when these 
models are integrated or form part of an AI system. It should be understood that the 
obligations for the providers of general-purpose AI models should apply once the 
general-purpose AI models are placed on the market.

Document 102: EN
United in diversity
EN
When the provider of a general-purpose AI model integrates an own model into its own 
AI system that is made available on the market or put into service, that model should be 
considered to be placed on the market and, therefore, the obligations in this Regulation 
for models should continue to apply in addition to those for AI systems. The obligations 
laid down for models should in any case not apply when an own model is used for purely 
internal processes that are not essential for providing a product or a service to third 
parties and the rights of natural persons are not affected. Considering their potential 
significantly negative effects, the general-purpose AI models with systemic risk should 
always be subject to the relevant obligations under this Regulation. The definition 
should not cover AI models used before their placing on the market for the sole purpose 
of research, development and prototyping activities. This is without prejudice to the 
obligation to comply with this Regulation when, following such activities, a model is 
placed on the market.
(98)
Whereas the generality of a model could, inter alia, also be determined by a number of 
parameters, models with at least a billion of parameters and trained with a large amount 
of data using self-supervision at scale should be considered to display significant 
generality and to competently perform a wide range of distinctive tasks.
(99)
Large generative AI models are a typical example for a general-purpose AI model, given 
that they allow for flexible generation of content, such as in the form of text, audio, 
images or video, that can readily accommodate a wide range of distinctive tasks.",[],"{'question_type': 'rule_conclusion', 'seed_document_id': 101, 'topic': 'Others'}","Whether a large generative AI model should be classified as a general-purpose AI model under relevant regulations depends on the specific definitions and criteria set forth in the applicable legal framework, such as the EU AI Act or similar regulations in other jurisdictions.

### Classification as General-Purpose AI

1. **Definition**: General-purpose AI typically refers to AI systems that can be adapted for a wide range of tasks and applications, rather than being designed for a specific function. If the generative AI model can produce various forms of content (text, images, music, etc.) and is intended for use across multiple sectors, it may indeed be classified as a general-purpose AI.

2. **Intended Use**: The classification may also depend on the intended use of the model. If the model is marketed for diverse applications (e.g., content creation, marketing, education), it strengthens the case for it being considered general-purpose.

### Obligations Under Regulation

If classified as a general-purpose AI model, several obligations may apply, including:

1. **Risk Assessment**: The company may need to conduct a risk assessment to identify potential risks associated with the use of the AI model, particularly in high-risk applications.

2. **Transparency**: There may be requirements for transparency, including providing information about the model's capabilities, limitations, and the data it was trained on.

3. **Data Governance**: Compliance with data protection regulations (like GDPR) is crucial, especially if the model processes personal data. This includes ensuring data quality, security, and user consent.

4. **Human Oversight**: Depending on the model's applications, there may be obligations to ensure human oversight, particularly in high-stakes scenarios where decisions made by the AI could significantly impact individuals.

5. **Accountability**: The company may need to establish accountability mechanisms for the outputs generated by the AI, including addressing issues related to misinformation, bias, or harmful content.

6. **Monitoring and Reporting**: Ongoing monitoring of the AI's performance and impact may be required, along with reporting obligations to regulatory bodies.

7. **User Guidance**: Providing users with guidelines on how to use the AI responsibly and ethically may also be necessary.

### Conclusion

In summary, if the generative AI model is classified as a general-purpose AI, the company would need to adhere to various obligations aimed at ensuring safety, transparency, and accountability. It is essential for the company to consult legal experts familiar with the specific regulations in their jurisdiction to ensure compliance.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed analysis but does not directly affirm that the model should be classified as a general-purpose AI model, which is the core of the ground truth answer.",0.3666666666666666,0.0,4.0,"The generated answer correctly addresses the classification of the AI model and outlines relevant obligations, but it is somewhat verbose and could be more concise while still maintaining accuracy."

1. **Demonstration of Due Diligence**: Taking prompt action to address the infringement shows that the institution is exercising due diligence. This can be a mitigating factor when assessing liability, as it indicates a proactive approach to compliance and risk management.

2. **Mitigation of Harm**: Immediate action to mitigate damage can reduce the overall impact of the infringement on affected individuals. This can be considered when evaluating the severity of the violation and the institution's responsibility.

3. **Cooperation with Authorities**: If the institution cooperates with relevant authorities (such as data protection regulators) after discovering the infringement, this can further demonstrate a commitment to compliance and accountability, potentially leading to more favorable outcomes in any investigations or penalties.

4. **Implementation of Corrective Measures**: If the institution implements corrective measures to prevent future infringements, this can be viewed positively. It shows a commitment to improving practices and ensuring compliance with the EU AI Act and data protection regulations.

5. **Contextual Factors**: The context of the infringement, including whether it was a result of negligence or an isolated incident, will also be considered. Immediate corrective actions can help frame the incident as less severe.

1. **Compliance with the AI Act**: The company must ensure that its AI system complies with the provisions of the AI Act, which categorizes AI systems based on their risk levels (e.g., minimal, limited, high, and unacceptable risk). Depending on the classification of the AI system, different requirements will apply.

2. **Standardisation Requests**: The EU AI Act encourages the development of harmonised standards to facilitate compliance. The company may need to align its AI system with these standards, which are developed by European standardisation organisations. This alignment can help demonstrate compliance with the legal requirements.

3. **Conformity Assessment**: For high-risk AI systems, the company may need to undergo a conformity assessment to ensure that the system meets the necessary standards and requirements before it can be placed on the market.

4. **Documentation and Reporting**: The company will also need to maintain proper documentation and reporting mechanisms to demonstrate compliance with the AI Act and any relevant harmonised standards.

5. **Ongoing Monitoring**: After the launch, the company should be prepared for ongoing monitoring and potential updates to ensure continued compliance with evolving regulations and standards.

In summary, aligning with the existing Union harmonisation legislation is crucial for the successful launch and operation of the AI system in the EU market.",True,"The agent's answer correctly states that the company needs to align its standards with the existing Union harmonisation legislation as specified by the Commission under the EU AI Act, and it provides additional relevant details about compliance and requirements.",0.45,0.882352888584137,5.0,"The generated answer is completely correct, addressing all components of the user query accurately and providing additional relevant information without any errors."

Generally, law enforcement authorities are government entities with the power to enforce laws, conduct investigations, and make arrests. Private security companies, on the other hand, are usually hired by businesses or individuals to provide security services and do not possess the same legal powers as public law enforcement agencies.

### Implications of Classification:

1. **Powers**: 
   - If classified as a law enforcement authority, the private security company may gain certain powers, such as the ability to detain suspects, conduct searches, or access law enforcement databases. However, this is rare and usually requires specific legal provisions or partnerships with local law enforcement.
   - If not classified as such, the company would have limited powers, primarily focused on surveillance, reporting incidents, and possibly detaining individuals until law enforcement arrives.

2. **Responsibilities**:
   - As a law enforcement authority, the company would be expected to adhere to strict legal standards, including the protection of civil rights, proper handling of evidence, and following due process.
   - Without this classification, the company would primarily be responsible for maintaining safety and security within the mall, reporting crimes to law enforcement, and cooperating with investigations.

3. **Liability**:
   - Being classified as a law enforcement authority could expose the company to greater legal scrutiny and liability, especially if it oversteps its bounds or violates individuals' rights.
   - If it operates as a private entity, its liability may be limited to contractual obligations and negligence in providing security services.

4. **Collaboration with Law Enforcement**:
   - A private security company may work closely with local law enforcement, but its classification affects how this collaboration is structured. If it has law enforcement authority, it may have more formalized protocols for sharing information and coordinating responses.

### Conclusion:
In most cases, a private security company investigating thefts in a shopping mall would not be classified as a law enforcement authority. This classification significantly impacts its powers, responsibilities, and legal liabilities. It is essential for the company to operate within the legal framework established for private security to ensure compliance and effective collaboration with law enforcement agencies.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed analysis but ultimately concludes that a private security company would not be classified as a law enforcement authority, which aligns with the ground truth.

ANNEX XIII
Criteria for the designation of general-purpose AI models 
with systemic risk referred to in Article 51
For the purpose of determining that a general-purpose AI model has capabilities or an 
impact equivalent to those set out in Article 51(1), point (a), the Commission shall take into 
account the following criteria:
(a)
the number of parameters of the model;
(b)
the quality or size of the data set, for example measured through tokens;
(c)
the amount of computation used for training the model, measured in floating point 
operations or indicated by a combination of other variables such as estimated cost 
of training, estimated time required for the training, or estimated energy 
consumption for the training;
(d)
the input and output modalities of the model, such as text to text (large language 
models), text to image, multi-modality, and the state of the art thresholds for 
determining high-impact capabilities for each modality, and the specific type of 
inputs and outputs (e.g. biological sequences);
(e)
the benchmarks and evaluations of capabilities of the model, including 
considering the number of tasks without additional training, adaptability to learn 
new, distinct tasks, its level of autonomy and scalability, the tools it has access to;
(f)
whether it has a high impact on the internal market due to its reach, which shall 
be presumed when it has been made available to at least 10 000 registered business 
users established in the Union;
(g)
the number of registered end-users.

Document 113: EN
United in diversity
EN
(112)
It is also necessary to clarify a procedure for the classification of a general-purpose AI 
model with systemic risks. A general-purpose AI model that meets the applicable 
threshold for high-impact capabilities should be presumed to be a general-purpose AI 
models with systemic risk. The provider should notify the AI Office at the latest two 
weeks after the requirements are met or it becomes known that a general-purpose AI 
model will meet the requirements that lead to the presumption. This is especially relevant 
in relation to the threshold of floating point operations because training of general-
purpose AI models takes considerable planning which includes the upfront allocation of 
compute resources and, therefore, providers of general-purpose AI models are able to 
know if their model would meet the threshold before the training is completed. In the 
context of that notification, the provider should be able to demonstrate that, because of 
its specific characteristics, a general-purpose AI model exceptionally does not present 
systemic risks, and that it thus should not be classified as a general-purpose AI model 
with systemic risks. That information is valuable for the AI Office to anticipate the 
placing on the market of general-purpose AI models with systemic risks and the 
providers can start to engage with the AI Office early on. That information is especially 
important with regard to general-purpose AI models that are planned to be released as 
open-source, given that, after the open-source model release, necessary measures to 
ensure compliance with the obligations under this Regulation may be more difficult to 
implement.",[],"{'question_type': 'rule_conclusion', 'seed_document_id': 299, 'topic': 'Systemic Risks in AI'}","Under the EU AI Act, the assessment of a tech company's argument regarding the systemic risks of its general-purpose AI model involves several key considerations:

1. **Compliance with the AI Act**: The Commission should first ensure that the AI model meets the defined thresholds for high-risk AI systems, including the floating point operations threshold. If it qualifies as high-risk, it must comply with the relevant requirements set out in the Act.

2. **Risk Assessment**: The company must conduct a thorough risk assessment of its AI model, identifying potential risks associated with its use. This includes evaluating the model's design, functionality, and the contexts in which it will be deployed.

3. **Unique Design Claims**: The Commission should critically evaluate the company's claims about its unique design. This involves examining the technical specifications, algorithms, and methodologies used in the model. The company should provide evidence that its design effectively mitigates systemic risks, such as bias, discrimination, or unintended consequences.

4. **Transparency and Documentation**: The company should be required to provide comprehensive documentation that outlines how its design addresses potential risks. This includes transparency in the model's decision-making processes, data sources, and training methodologies.

5. **Independent Audits and Testing**: The Commission may consider requiring independent audits or third-party evaluations of the AI model to validate the company's claims. This can help ensure that the model operates safely and as intended in real-world scenarios.

6. **Stakeholder Consultation**: Engaging with stakeholders, including users, affected communities, and experts in AI ethics and safety, can provide additional insights into the potential risks and benefits of the AI model.

7. **Monitoring and Reporting**: The Commission should establish mechanisms for ongoing monitoring and reporting of the AI model's performance and impact post-deployment. This can help identify any emerging risks that were not initially anticipated.

8. **Regulatory Flexibility**: The Commission may need to consider the possibility of regulatory flexibility, allowing for adjustments based on the model's performance and the evolving understanding of AI risks.

By taking these steps, the Commission can assess the validity of the company's argument regarding systemic risks and ensure that the AI model aligns with the objectives of the EU AI Act, promoting safety, accountability, and ethical use of AI technologies.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed assessment process but does not directly address the need for the argument to be sufficiently substantiated.

authorisation by a judicial authority or by an independent administrative authority of a 
Member State whose decision is binding. Such authorisation should, in principle, be 
obtained prior to the use of the AI system with a view to identifying a person or persons. 
Exceptions to that rule should be allowed in duly justified situations on grounds of 
urgency, namely in situations where the need to use the systems concerned is such as to 
make it effectively and objectively impossible to obtain an authorisation before 
commencing the use of the AI system. In such situations of urgency, the use of the AI 
system should be restricted to the absolute minimum necessary and should be subject to 
appropriate safeguards and conditions, as determined in national law and specified in the 
context of each individual urgent use case by the law enforcement authority itself. In 
addition, the law enforcement authority should in such situations request such 
authorisation ▌ while providing the reasons for not having been able to request it earlier, 
without undue delay and at the latest within 24 hours. If such an authorisation is 
rejected, the use of real-time biometric identification systems linked to that authorisation 
should cease with immediate effect and all the data related to such use should be 
discarded and deleted. Such data includes input data directly acquired by an AI system 
in the course of the use of such system as well as the results and outputs of the use 
linked to that authorisation. It should not include input that is legally acquired in 
accordance with another Union or national law. In any case, no decision producing an

authority or ▌ an independent administrative authority whose decision is binding of the 
Member State in which the use is to take place, issued upon a reasoned request and in 
accordance with the detailed rules of national law referred to in paragraph 5. However, in a 
duly justified situation of urgency, the use of such system may be commenced without an

The use of AI systems for real-time remote biometric identification of natural persons in 
publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement necessarily involves the 
processing of biometric data. The rules of this Regulation that prohibit, subject to certain 
exceptions, such use, which are based on Article 16 TFEU, should apply as lex specialis in 
respect of the rules on the processing of biometric data contained in Article 10 of Directive 
(EU) 2016/680, thus regulating such use and the processing of biometric data involved in 
an exhaustive manner. Therefore, such use and processing should be possible only in as far 
as it is compatible with the framework set by this Regulation, without there being scope, 
outside that framework, for the competent authorities, where they act for purpose of law 
enforcement, to use such systems and process such data in connection thereto on the 
grounds listed in Article 10 of Directive (EU) 2016/680. In that context, this Regulation is 
not intended to provide the legal basis for the processing of personal data under Article 8 
of Directive (EU) 2016/680. However, the use of real-time remote biometric identification 
systems in publicly accessible spaces for purposes other than law enforcement, including 
by competent authorities, should not be covered by the specific framework regarding such 
use for the purpose of law enforcement set by this Regulation. Such use for purposes other 
than law enforcement should therefore not be subject to the requirement of an authorisation 
under this Regulation and the applicable detailed rules of national law that may give effect 
to that authorisation.

The use of AI systems for ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification of natural persons in 
publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement is particularly intrusive to 
the rights and freedoms of the concerned persons, to the extent that it may affect the 
private life of a large part of the population, evoke a feeling of constant surveillance and 
indirectly dissuade the exercise of the freedom of assembly and other fundamental rights. 
Technical inaccuracies of AI systems intended for the remote biometric identification of 
natural persons can lead to biased results and entail discriminatory effects. Such 
possible biased results and discriminatory effects are particularly relevant with regard to 
age, ethnicity, race, sex or disabilities. In addition, the immediacy of the impact and the 
limited opportunities for further checks or corrections in relation to the use of such systems 
operating in real-time carry heightened risks for the rights and freedoms of the persons 
concerned in the context of, or impacted by, law enforcement activities.
(33)
The use of those systems for the purpose of law enforcement should therefore be 
prohibited, except in exhaustively listed and narrowly defined situations, where the use is 
strictly necessary to achieve a substantial public interest, the importance of which 
outweighs the risks. Those situations involve the search for certain victims of crime ▌ 
including missing persons; certain threats to the life or to the physical safety of natural 
persons or of a terrorist attack; and the localisation or identification of perpetrators or 
suspects of the criminal offences listed in an annex to this Regulation, where those 
criminal offences are punishable in the Member State concerned by a custodial sentence or 
a detention order for a maximum period of at least four years and as they are defined in the 
law of that Member State. Such a threshold for the custodial sentence or detention order in 
accordance with national law contributes to ensuring that the offence should be serious 
enough to potentially justify the use of ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification systems.",[],"{'question_type': 'distracting element', 'seed_document_id': 38, 'distracting_context': 'EN\nUnited in diversity\nEN\nArticle 37\nChallenge to the competence of notified bodies\n1.\nThe Commission shall, where necessary, investigate all cases where there are reasons to \ndoubt the competence of a notified body or the continued fulfilment by a notified body of \nthe requirements laid down in Article 31 and of its applicable responsibilities.\n2.\nThe notifying authority shall provide the Commission, on request, with all relevant \ninformation relating to the notification or the maintenance of the competence of the \nnotified body concerned.\n3.\nThe Commission shall ensure that all sensitive information obtained in the course of its \ninvestigations pursuant to this Article is treated confidentially in accordance with \nArticle 78.\n4.\nWhere the Commission ascertains that a notified body does not meet or no longer meets \nthe requirements for its notification, it shall inform the notifying Member State \naccordingly and request it to take the necessary corrective measures, including the \nsuspension or withdrawal of the notification if necessary.

Here are several key aspects of this role:

1. **Framework for Compliance**: Standardization provides a clear framework that organizations can follow to ensure they meet regulatory requirements. This is particularly important in a phased implementation timeline, as it allows companies to align their processes and technologies with the evolving regulatory landscape.

2. **Consistency Across Industries**: By establishing common standards, organizations across different sectors can ensure a level of consistency in compliance efforts. This is vital in industries where technology is rapidly evolving, as it helps mitigate risks associated with non-compliance and fosters trust among stakeholders.

3. **Facilitating Innovation**: Standardization can help bridge the gap between innovation and regulation. As new technologies emerge, standardized guidelines can help organizations understand how to integrate these innovations while remaining compliant, thus promoting a balance between technological advancement and regulatory adherence.

4. **Governance Structures**: Effective governance structures often rely on standardized practices to ensure accountability and transparency. Standardization helps define roles, responsibilities, and processes within these structures, making it easier to monitor compliance and enforce regulations.

5. **Risk Management**: Standardized protocols can aid in identifying and managing risks associated with new technologies. By adhering to established standards, organizations can better assess potential compliance risks and implement necessary controls.

6. **Training and Awareness**: Standardization simplifies training and awareness programs for employees. When everyone is on the same page regarding compliance standards, it enhances the overall understanding of regulatory requirements and fosters a culture of compliance within the organization.

7. **Facilitating Communication**: Standardized terminology and processes enhance communication between regulators, organizations, and stakeholders. This clarity is essential for effective compliance, especially as regulations evolve in response to technological changes.

8. **Benchmarking and Best Practices**: Standardization allows organizations to benchmark their practices against industry standards and best practices. This can drive continuous improvement and help organizations stay ahead of regulatory changes.

online platforms and very large online search engines are obliged to assess potential 
systemic risks stemming from the design, functioning and use of their services, including 
how the design of algorithmic systems used in the service may contribute to such risks, 
as well as systemic risks stemming from potential misuses. Those providers are also

Considering the quick pace of innovation and the technological evolution of digital 
services in scope of different instruments of Union law in particular having in mind the 
usage and the perception of their recipients, the AI systems subject to this Regulation 
may be provided as intermediary services or parts thereof within the meaning of 
Regulation (EU) 2022/2065, which should be interpreted in a technology-neutral 
manner. For example, AI systems may be used to provide online search engines, in 
particular, to the extent that an AI system such as an online chatbot performs searches 
of, in principle, all websites, then incorporates the results into its existing knowledge and 
uses the updated knowledge to generate a single output that combines different sources 
of information.

Furthermore, obligations placed on providers and deployers of certain AI systems in this 
Regulation to enable the detection and disclosure that the outputs of those systems are 
artificially generated or manipulated are particularly relevant to facilitate the effective 
implementation of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065. This applies in particular as regards the 
obligations of providers of very large online platforms or very large online search

"What specific actions should a provider undertake if their general-purpose AI model meets the threshold for high-impact capabilities, particularly in relation to the information required under Article 49(3) for high-risk AI systems?",The provider should notify the AI Office at the latest two weeks after the requirements are met or it becomes known that a general-purpose AI model will meet the requirements that lead to the presumption.,"Document 111: EN
United in diversity
EN
(111)
It is appropriate to establish a methodology for the classification of general-purpose AI 
models as general-purpose AI model with systemic risks. Since systemic risks result from 
particularly high capabilities, a general-purpose AI model should be considered to 
present systemic risks if it has high-impact capabilities, evaluated on the basis of 
appropriate technical tools and methodologies, or significant impact on the internal 
market due to its reach. High-impact capabilities in general-purpose AI models means 
capabilities that match or exceed the capabilities recorded in the most advanced general-
purpose AI models. The full range of capabilities in a model could be better understood 
after its placing on the market or when deployers interact with the model. According to 
the state of the art at the time of entry into force of this Regulation, the cumulative 
amount of computation used for the training of the general-purpose AI model measured 
in floating point operations is one of the relevant approximations for model capabilities. 
The cumulative amount of computation used for training includes the computation used 
across the activities and methods that are intended to enhance the capabilities of the 
model prior to deployment, such as pre-training, synthetic data generation and fine-
tuning. Therefore, an initial threshold of floating point operations should be set, which, 
if met by a general-purpose AI model, leads to a presumption that the model is a 
general-purpose AI model with systemic risks. This threshold should be adjusted over 
time to reflect technological and industrial changes, such as algorithmic improvements 
or increased hardware efficiency, and should be supplemented with benchmarks and 
indicators for model capability.

Document 113: EN
United in diversity
EN
(112)
It is also necessary to clarify a procedure for the classification of a general-purpose AI 
model with systemic risks. A general-purpose AI model that meets the applicable 
threshold for high-impact capabilities should be presumed to be a general-purpose AI 
models with systemic risk. The provider should notify the AI Office at the latest two 
weeks after the requirements are met or it becomes known that a general-purpose AI 
model will meet the requirements that lead to the presumption. This is especially relevant 
in relation to the threshold of floating point operations because training of general-
purpose AI models takes considerable planning which includes the upfront allocation of 
compute resources and, therefore, providers of general-purpose AI models are able to 
know if their model would meet the threshold before the training is completed. In the 
context of that notification, the provider should be able to demonstrate that, because of 
its specific characteristics, a general-purpose AI model exceptionally does not present 
systemic risks, and that it thus should not be classified as a general-purpose AI model 
with systemic risks. That information is valuable for the AI Office to anticipate the 
placing on the market of general-purpose AI models with systemic risks and the 
providers can start to engage with the AI Office early on. That information is especially 
important with regard to general-purpose AI models that are planned to be released as 
open-source, given that, after the open-source model release, necessary measures to 
ensure compliance with the obligations under this Regulation may be more difficult to 
implement.

Document 112: EN
United in diversity
EN
To inform this, the AI Office should engage with the scientific community, industry, civil 
society and other experts. Thresholds, as well as tools and benchmarks for the 
assessment of high-impact capabilities, should be strong predictors of generality, its 
capabilities and associated systemic risk of general-purpose AI models, and could take 
into account the way the model will be placed on the market or the number of users it 
may affect. To complement this system, there should be a possibility for the Commission 
to take individual decisions designating a general-purpose AI model as a general-
purpose AI model with systemic risk if it is found that such model has capabilities or an 
impact equivalent to those captured by the set threshold. That decision should be taken 
on the basis of an overall assessment of the criteria for the designation of a general-
purpose AI model with systemic risk set out in an annex to this Regulation, such as 
quality or size of the training data set, number of business and end users, its input and 
output modalities, its level of autonomy and scalability, or the tools it has access to. 
Upon a reasoned request of a provider whose model has been designated as a general-
purpose AI model with systemic risk, the Commission should take the request into 
account and may decide to reassess whether the general-purpose AI model can still be 
considered to present systemic risks.",[],"{'question_type': 'distracting element', 'seed_document_id': 111, 'distracting_context': 'EN\nUnited in diversity\nEN\nSection C - Information to be submitted by deployers of high-risk AI systems in accordance with \nArticle 49(3)\nThe following information shall be provided and thereafter kept up to date with regard to high-\nrisk AI systems to be registered in accordance with Article 49:\n1.\nThe name, address and contact details of the deployer;\n2.\nThe name, address and contact details of the person submitting information on behalf of \nthe deployer;\n3.\nThe URL of the entry of the AI system in the EU database by its provider;\n4.\nA summary of the findings of the fundamental rights impact assessment conducted in \naccordance with Article 27;\n5.\nA summary of the data protection impact assessment carried out in accordance with \nArticle 35 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 or Article 27 of Directive (EU) 2016/680 as \nspecified in Article 26(8) of this Regulation, where applicable.', 'topic': 'Systemic Risks in AI'}","If a provider's general-purpose AI model meets the threshold for high-impact capabilities, they should take several specific actions to comply with the requirements outlined in Article 49(3) for high-risk AI systems.

programmes at all levels, for evaluating learning outcomes of persons, for assessing the 
appropriate level of education for an individual and materially influencing the level of 
education and training that individuals will receive or will be able to access or for 
monitoring and detecting prohibited behaviour of students during tests should be 
classified as high-risk AI systems, since they may determine the educational and

Here are some key justifications:

### 1. **Impact on Fundamental Rights**
   - **Privacy Concerns**: AI systems often process large amounts of personal data, including sensitive information about students. Mismanagement or breaches can lead to violations of privacy rights.
   - **Discrimination and Bias**: AI algorithms can perpetuate or exacerbate existing biases, leading to unfair treatment of students based on race, gender, socioeconomic status, or disability. This can affect access to educational resources and opportunities.
   - **Right to Education**: AI systems that determine educational pathways or assessments can impact a student's right to receive a fair and equitable education. Misguided AI decisions can limit opportunities for certain groups.

### 2. **Potential for Misuse**
   - **Surveillance and Monitoring**: AI tools can be used for excessive monitoring of students, leading to a culture of surveillance that infringes on students' rights to freedom and autonomy.
   - **Manipulation of Learning**: AI systems that adapt learning materials based on data can inadvertently manipulate students' learning experiences, potentially leading to a one-size-fits-all approach that does not cater to individual needs.

### 3. **Transparency and Accountability**
   - **Opaque Decision-Making**: Many AI systems operate as ""black boxes,"" making it difficult to understand how decisions are made. This lack of transparency can hinder accountability, especially when decisions adversely affect students.
   - **Informed Consent**: Students and parents may not fully understand how AI systems use their data, raising ethical concerns about informed consent.

### 4. **Quality of Education**
   - **Reliability of AI Systems**: The effectiveness of AI in educational settings can vary significantly. Poorly designed or tested systems can lead to misinformation or inadequate educational support, impacting learning outcomes.
   - **Dependency on Technology**: Over-reliance on AI systems can undermine traditional teaching methods and critical thinking skills, potentially diminishing the quality of education.

### 5. **Regulatory Compliance**
   - **Legal Frameworks**: Many jurisdictions have laws and regulations that protect fundamental rights, such as the GDPR in Europe. Classifying educational AI as high-risk ensures compliance with these frameworks and promotes responsible use of technology.

### 6. **Need for Robust Testing and Development**
   - **Risk Mitigation**: High-risk classification necessitates thorough testing and validation of AI systems to identify and mitigate potential risks before deployment. This includes ensuring that systems are fair, transparent, and effective.
   - **Stakeholder Involvement**: Engaging educators, students, and parents in the development and testing phases can help identify potential issues and improve the system's design and implementation.

### 7. **Long-term Societal Impacts**
   - **Future Workforce**: AI systems in education shape the skills and competencies of future generations. Misguided AI applications can lead to a workforce ill-prepared for the demands of the future, impacting economic and social structures.

public services and deployers of certain high-risk AI systems listed in an annex to this 
Regulation, such as banking or insurance entities, should carry out a fundamental 
rights impact assessment prior to putting it into use. Services important for individuals 
that are of public nature may also be provided by private entities. Private entities 
providing such public services are linked to tasks in the public interest such as in the 
areas of education, healthcare, social services, housing, administration of justice. The 
aim of the fundamental rights impact assessment is for the deployer to identify the 
specific risks to the rights of individuals or groups of individuals likely to be affected, 
identify measures to be taken in the case of a materialisation of those risks. The impact 
assessment should be performed prior to deploying the high-risk AI system, and should 
be updated when the deployer considers that any of the relevant factors have changed. 
The impact assessment should identify the deployer’s relevant processes in which the 
high-risk AI system will be used in line with its intended purpose, and should include a 
description of the period of time and frequency in which the system is intended to be 
used as well as of specific categories of natural persons and groups who are likely to be 
affected in the specific context of use.

Document 100: EN

EN
The assessment should also include the identification of specific risks of harm likely to 
have an impact on the fundamental rights of those persons or groups. While performing 
this assessment, the deployer should take into account information relevant to a proper 
assessment of the impact, including but not limited to the information given by the 
provider of the high-risk AI system in the instructions for use. In light of the risks 
identified, deployers should determine measures to be taken in the case of a 
materialisation of those risks, including for example governance arrangements in that 
specific context of use, such as arrangements for human oversight according to the 
instructions of use or, complaint handling and redress procedures, as they could be 
instrumental in mitigating risks to fundamental rights in concrete use-cases. After 
performing that impact assessment, the deployer should notify the relevant market 
surveillance authority. Where appropriate, to collect relevant information necessary to 
perform the impact assessment, deployers of high-risk AI system, in particular when AI 
systems are used in the public sector, could involve relevant stakeholders, including the 
representatives of groups of persons likely to be affected by the AI system, independent 
experts, and civil society organisations in conducting such impact assessments and 
designing measures to be taken in the case of materialisation of the risks. The European 
Artificial Intelligence Office (AI Office) should develop a template for a questionnaire in 
order to facilitate compliance and reduce the administrative burden for deployers.",[],"{'question_type': 'distracting element', 'seed_document_id': 255, 'distracting_context': 'EN\nUnited in diversity\nEN\n(62)\n‘critical infrastructure’ means critical infrastructure as defined in Article 2, point (4), of \nDirective (EU) 2022/2557;\n(63)\n‘general-purpose AI model’ means an AI model, including where such an AI model is \ntrained with a large amount of data using self-supervision at scale, that displays \nsignificant generality and is capable of competently performing a wide range of distinct \ntasks regardless of the way the model is placed on the market and that can be integrated \ninto a variety of downstream systems or applications, except AI models that are used for \nresearch, development or prototyping activities before they are placed on the market;\n(64)\n‘high-impact capabilities’ means capabilities that match or exceed the capabilities \nrecorded in the most advanced general-purpose AI models;\n(65)\n‘systemic risk’ means a risk that is specific to the high-impact capabilities of general-\npurpose AI models, having a significant impact on the Union market due to their reach, \nor due to actual or reasonably foreseeable negative effects on public health, safety, \npublic security, fundamental rights, or the society as a whole, that can be propagated at \nscale across the value chain;', 'topic': 'Others'}","The fundamental rights impact assessment (FRIA) plays a crucial role in evaluating high-risk AI systems, particularly in the context of systemic risks that could affect public health and safety. Here’s how it functions:

### 1. **Identification of Risks**
   - **Systemic Risks**: FRIA helps identify potential systemic risks associated with AI systems, such as biases in data that could lead to unequal health outcomes or safety hazards.
   - **Public Health and Safety**: It assesses how AI systems might impact public health and safety, ensuring that any adverse effects are recognized early in the development process.

### 2. **Evaluation of Fundamental Rights**
   - **Rights Protection**: The assessment evaluates how AI systems align with fundamental rights, such as the right to health, privacy, and non-discrimination.
   - **Impact on Vulnerable Groups**: It pays special attention to how these systems might disproportionately affect marginalized or vulnerable populations.

### 3. **Mitigation Strategies**
   - **Risk Mitigation**: FRIA provides recommendations for mitigating identified risks, ensuring that AI systems are designed and implemented in ways that protect fundamental rights.
   - **Design Improvements**: It encourages the incorporation of ethical considerations and human rights into the design and deployment of AI systems.

### 4. **Transparency and Accountability**
   - **Documentation**: The assessment promotes transparency by documenting the potential impacts of AI systems on fundamental rights, which can be crucial for accountability.
   - **Stakeholder Engagement**: It often involves engaging with stakeholders, including affected communities, to gather diverse perspectives on potential impacts.

### 5. **Regulatory Compliance**
   - **Alignment with Legal Frameworks**: FRIA ensures that AI systems comply with existing legal frameworks related to human rights, public health, and safety.
   - **Guidance for Policymakers**: It provides insights that can inform policymakers and regulators in creating guidelines and regulations for high-risk AI systems.

### 6. **Continuous Monitoring**
   - **Ongoing Assessment**: FRIA is not a one-time process; it encourages continuous monitoring and reassessment of AI systems as they evolve and as new risks emerge.
   - **Feedback Loops**: It establishes mechanisms for feedback and adaptation, ensuring that AI systems remain aligned with fundamental rights over time.

### Conclusion
In summary, the fundamental rights impact assessment is essential for ensuring that high-risk AI systems are developed and deployed responsibly, with a focus on protecting public health and safety. By systematically evaluating potential risks and impacts on fundamental rights, FRIA helps create a framework for ethical AI that prioritizes human dignity and well-being.",False,The agent's answer provides a detailed explanation of the role of the fundamental rights impact assessment (FRIA) but does not directly address the specific purpose of identifying risks to individual rights and measures to mitigate those risks as stated in the ground truth.,0.3939393939393939,0.8770041465759277,5.0,"The generated answer comprehensively addresses the user query by detailing the role of the fundamental rights impact assessment in evaluating high-risk AI systems, covering all relevant components accurately without any errors."

The use of AI systems for ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification of natural persons in 
publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement is particularly intrusive to 
the rights and freedoms of the concerned persons, to the extent that it may affect the 
private life of a large part of the population, evoke a feeling of constant surveillance and 
indirectly dissuade the exercise of the freedom of assembly and other fundamental rights. 
Technical inaccuracies of AI systems intended for the remote biometric identification of 
natural persons can lead to biased results and entail discriminatory effects. Such 
possible biased results and discriminatory effects are particularly relevant with regard to 
age, ethnicity, race, sex or disabilities. In addition, the immediacy of the impact and the 
limited opportunities for further checks or corrections in relation to the use of such systems 
operating in real-time carry heightened risks for the rights and freedoms of the persons 
concerned in the context of, or impacted by, law enforcement activities.
(33)
The use of those systems for the purpose of law enforcement should therefore be 
prohibited, except in exhaustively listed and narrowly defined situations, where the use is 
strictly necessary to achieve a substantial public interest, the importance of which 
outweighs the risks. Those situations involve the search for certain victims of crime ▌ 
including missing persons; certain threats to the life or to the physical safety of natural 
persons or of a terrorist attack; and the localisation or identification of perpetrators or 
suspects of the criminal offences listed in an annex to this Regulation, where those 
criminal offences are punishable in the Member State concerned by a custodial sentence or 
a detention order for a maximum period of at least four years and as they are defined in the 
law of that Member State. Such a threshold for the custodial sentence or detention order in 
accordance with national law contributes to ensuring that the offence should be serious 
enough to potentially justify the use of ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification systems.",[],"{'question_type': 'distracting element', 'seed_document_id': 38, 'distracting_context': 'EN\nUnited in diversity\nEN\nArticle 76\nSupervision of testing in real world conditions by market surveillance authorities\n1.\nMarket surveillance authorities shall have competences and powers to ensure that \ntesting in real world conditions is in accordance with this Regulation.\n2.\nWhere testing in real world conditions is conducted for AI systems that are supervised \nwithin an AI regulatory sandbox under Article 58, the market surveillance authorities \nshall verify the compliance with Article 60 as part of their supervisory role for the AI \nregulatory sandbox.

2. **Cloud Services**: AI models offered through cloud computing platforms that can be accessed by businesses and individuals, often on a pay-per-use basis.

3. **APIs and Online Tools**: Interfaces that allow users to integrate AI capabilities into their applications or workflows without needing deep technical expertise.

4. **Public Datasets**: Datasets that are freely available for training AI models, which can lead to the development of new applications and innovations.

### Implications for Systemic Risks:

1. **Widespread Adoption**: The accessibility of powerful AI models can lead to rapid adoption across various sectors, increasing the potential for unintended consequences and systemic risks.

2. **Market Disruption**: As businesses leverage these models, traditional industries may face disruption, leading to economic instability or job displacement.

3. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Public access can also lead to misuse, where malicious actors exploit AI capabilities for harmful purposes, such as misinformation or cyberattacks.

4. **Lack of Regulation**: The open nature of these spaces may outpace regulatory frameworks, making it challenging to manage risks associated with AI deployment.

5. **Bias and Fairness**: Publicly accessible models may perpetuate or amplify biases present in training data, leading to unfair outcomes in critical areas like hiring, lending, and law enforcement.

1. **Data Privacy and Security Risks**:
   - **Data Breaches**: General-purpose AI models often require vast amounts of data for training. If these models are integrated into large-scale IT systems, they may inadvertently expose sensitive data, leading to breaches.
   - **Inadequate Anonymization**: Compliance with the EU AI Act may not sufficiently address the risks of re-identification of individuals from anonymized datasets used in training AI models.

2. **Bias and Discrimination**:
   - **Amplification of Existing Biases**: If general-purpose AI models are trained on biased datasets, they may perpetuate or amplify these biases when deployed in large-scale systems, leading to discriminatory outcomes in areas like hiring, lending, or law enforcement.
   - **Lack of Contextual Understanding**: General-purpose models may not account for specific legal or cultural contexts, resulting in inappropriate or harmful decisions when applied in regulated environments.

3. **Accountability and Liability Issues**:
   - **Ambiguity in Responsibility**: The integration of AI into large-scale IT systems can create confusion about accountability. If an AI system makes a harmful decision, it may be unclear whether the responsibility lies with the AI developers, the organizations using the AI, or the regulatory bodies.
   - **Challenges in Compliance Monitoring**: Ensuring that AI systems comply with the EU AI Act can be complex, especially when multiple stakeholders are involved. This can lead to gaps in oversight and accountability.

4. **Operational Risks**:
   - **Systemic Failures**: The reliance on general-purpose AI models in critical infrastructure can lead to systemic failures if the AI malfunctions or produces erroneous outputs, potentially affecting public safety and trust.
   - **Interoperability Issues**: Integrating AI models into existing IT systems may lead to compatibility issues, resulting in operational disruptions or inefficiencies.

5. **Economic and Market Risks**:
   - **Market Concentration**: The compliance requirements may favor larger organizations that can afford the resources to implement and maintain compliant AI systems, potentially stifling competition and innovation from smaller entities.
   - **Job Displacement**: The deployment of AI in large-scale systems may lead to significant job displacement, raising economic and social concerns that could destabilize communities.

6. **Regulatory Compliance Challenges**:
   - **Evolving Regulations**: The dynamic nature of AI technology may outpace regulatory frameworks, leading to compliance challenges and potential legal liabilities for organizations that fail to adapt quickly.
   - **Inconsistent Implementation**: Different interpretations of the EU AI Act across member states could lead to inconsistent compliance practices, creating a fragmented regulatory landscape.

7. **Public Trust and Acceptance**:
   - **Erosion of Trust**: If general-purpose AI models lead to negative outcomes, public trust in both AI technologies and the institutions that deploy them may erode, complicating future compliance and adoption efforts.
   - **Resistance to Adoption**: Concerns about the risks associated with AI may lead to resistance from stakeholders, hindering the effective implementation of AI solutions in public services.

This includes adherence to safety, transparency, and accountability standards.

2. **Fundamental Rights Impact Assessment**: Conducting a thorough assessment of how the AI model may impact fundamental rights, such as privacy, non-discrimination, and freedom of expression, is crucial. This assessment should identify potential risks and outline mitigation strategies.

3. **Data Protection and Privacy**: Compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is essential. Providers must ensure that their AI systems do not violate data protection rights, including the lawful processing of personal data and the rights of individuals regarding their data.

4. **Bias and Discrimination**: Providers should evaluate their models for biases that could lead to discriminatory outcomes. This includes analyzing training data for representativeness and ensuring that the AI does not perpetuate or exacerbate existing inequalities.

5. **Transparency and Explainability**: Ensuring that the AI model is transparent and its decision-making processes are explainable is vital. Users and affected individuals should be able to understand how decisions are made, especially in high-stakes scenarios.

6. **User and Stakeholder Engagement**: Engaging with stakeholders, including affected communities, civil society organizations, and regulatory bodies, can provide valuable insights into potential impacts and help address concerns related to fundamental rights.

7. **Monitoring and Reporting Mechanisms**: Establishing mechanisms for ongoing monitoring of the AI model's performance and its impact on fundamental rights is important. This includes setting up reporting systems for users to flag issues or harms caused by the AI.

8. **Liability and Accountability**: Providers must clarify their liability in cases where the AI model causes harm or violates rights. This includes understanding the legal implications of their technology under EU law.

9. **Cultural and Contextual Sensitivity**: Recognizing that fundamental rights may be interpreted differently across cultures and jurisdictions, providers should consider the specific context of the EU and its member states when assessing potential impacts.

10. **Collaboration with Local Entities**: Partnering with local organizations, experts, and regulatory bodies can help providers navigate the complexities of the EU market and ensure compliance with local norms and expectations.

(28)
Aside from the many beneficial uses of AI, it can also be misused and provide novel and 
powerful tools for manipulative, exploitative and social control practices. Such practices 
are particularly harmful and abusive and should be prohibited because they contradict 
Union values of respect for human dignity, freedom, equality, democracy and the rule of 
law and fundamental rights enshrined in the Charter, including the right to non-
discrimination, to data protection and to privacy and the rights of the child.
(29)
AI-enabled manipulative techniques can be used to persuade persons to engage in 
unwanted behaviours, or to deceive them by nudging them into decisions in a way that 
subverts and impairs their autonomy, decision-making and free choices. The placing on 
the market, the putting into service or the use of certain AI systems with the objective to or 
the effect of materially distorting human behaviour, whereby significant harms, in 
particular having sufficiently important adverse impacts on physical, psychological 
health or financial interests are likely to occur, are particularly dangerous and should 
therefore be prohibited. Such AI systems deploy subliminal components such as audio, 
image, video stimuli that persons cannot perceive, as those stimuli are beyond human 
perception, or other manipulative or deceptive techniques that subvert or impair person’s 
autonomy, decision-making or free choice in ways that people are not consciously aware 
of those techniques or, where they are aware of them, can still be deceived or are not 
able to control or resist them. This could be facilitated, for example, by machine-brain 
interfaces or virtual reality as they allow for a higher degree of control of what stimuli 
are presented to persons, insofar as they may materially distort their behaviour in a 
significantly harmful manner. In addition, AI systems may also otherwise exploit the 
vulnerabilities of a person or a specific group of persons due to their age, disability within 
the meaning of Directive (EU) 2019/882 of the European Parliament and of the 
Council16, or a specific social or economic situation that is likely to make those persons

(35)
Each use of a ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification system in publicly accessible 
spaces for the purpose of law enforcement should be subject to an express and specific 
authorisation by a judicial authority or by an independent administrative authority of a 
Member State whose decision is binding. Such authorisation should, in principle, be 
obtained prior to the use of the AI system with a view to identifying a person or persons. 
Exceptions to that rule should be allowed in duly justified situations on grounds of 
urgency, namely in situations where the need to use the systems concerned is such as to 
make it effectively and objectively impossible to obtain an authorisation before 
commencing the use of the AI system. In such situations of urgency, the use of the AI 
system should be restricted to the absolute minimum necessary and should be subject to 
appropriate safeguards and conditions, as determined in national law and specified in the 
context of each individual urgent use case by the law enforcement authority itself. In 
addition, the law enforcement authority should in such situations request such 
authorisation ▌ while providing the reasons for not having been able to request it earlier, 
without undue delay and at the latest within 24 hours. If such an authorisation is 
rejected, the use of real-time biometric identification systems linked to that authorisation 
should cease with immediate effect and all the data related to such use should be 
discarded and deleted. Such data includes input data directly acquired by an AI system 
in the course of the use of such system as well as the results and outputs of the use 
linked to that authorisation. It should not include input that is legally acquired in 
accordance with another Union or national law. In any case, no decision producing an 
adverse legal effect on a person should be taken based solely on the output of the remote 
biometric identification system.

For the purposes of paragraph 1, first subparagraph, point (h) and paragraph 2, each ▌ use 
for the purposes of law enforcement of a ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification system 
in publicly accessible spaces shall be subject to a prior authorisation granted by a judicial 
authority or ▌ an independent administrative authority whose decision is binding of the 
Member State in which the use is to take place, issued upon a reasoned request and in 
accordance with the detailed rules of national law referred to in paragraph 5. However, in a 
duly justified situation of urgency, the use of such system may be commenced without an 
authorisation provided that such authorisation is requested without undue delay, at the 
latest within 24 hours. If such authorisation is rejected, the use shall be stopped with 
immediate effect and all the data, as well as the results and outputs of that use shall be 
immediately discarded and deleted.
The competent judicial authority or an independent administrative authority whose 
decision is binding shall grant the authorisation only where it is satisfied, on the basis of 
objective evidence or clear indications presented to it, that the use of the ‘real-time’ remote 
biometric identification system concerned is necessary for, and proportionate to, achieving 
one of the objectives specified in paragraph 1, first subparagraph, point (h), as identified in 
the request and, in particular, remains limited to what is strictly necessary concerning 
the period of time as well as the geographic and personal scope. In deciding on the 
request, that authority shall take into account the elements referred to in paragraph 2. No 
decision that produces an adverse legal effect on a person may be taken based solely on 
the output of the ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification system.

The use of AI systems for real-time remote biometric identification of natural persons in 
publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement necessarily involves the 
processing of biometric data. The rules of this Regulation that prohibit, subject to certain 
exceptions, such use, which are based on Article 16 TFEU, should apply as lex specialis in 
respect of the rules on the processing of biometric data contained in Article 10 of Directive 
(EU) 2016/680, thus regulating such use and the processing of biometric data involved in 
an exhaustive manner. Therefore, such use and processing should be possible only in as far 
as it is compatible with the framework set by this Regulation, without there being scope, 
outside that framework, for the competent authorities, where they act for purpose of law 
enforcement, to use such systems and process such data in connection thereto on the 
grounds listed in Article 10 of Directive (EU) 2016/680. In that context, this Regulation is 
not intended to provide the legal basis for the processing of personal data under Article 8 
of Directive (EU) 2016/680. However, the use of real-time remote biometric identification 
systems in publicly accessible spaces for purposes other than law enforcement, including 
by competent authorities, should not be covered by the specific framework regarding such 
use for the purpose of law enforcement set by this Regulation. Such use for purposes other 
than law enforcement should therefore not be subject to the requirement of an authorisation 
under this Regulation and the applicable detailed rules of national law that may give effect 
to that authorisation.

The use of AI systems for ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification of natural persons in 
publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement is particularly intrusive to 
the rights and freedoms of the concerned persons, to the extent that it may affect the 
private life of a large part of the population, evoke a feeling of constant surveillance and 
indirectly dissuade the exercise of the freedom of assembly and other fundamental rights. 
Technical inaccuracies of AI systems intended for the remote biometric identification of 
natural persons can lead to biased results and entail discriminatory effects. Such 
possible biased results and discriminatory effects are particularly relevant with regard to 
age, ethnicity, race, sex or disabilities. In addition, the immediacy of the impact and the 
limited opportunities for further checks or corrections in relation to the use of such systems 
operating in real-time carry heightened risks for the rights and freedoms of the persons 
concerned in the context of, or impacted by, law enforcement activities.
(33)
The use of those systems for the purpose of law enforcement should therefore be 
prohibited, except in exhaustively listed and narrowly defined situations, where the use is 
strictly necessary to achieve a substantial public interest, the importance of which 
outweighs the risks. Those situations involve the search for certain victims of crime ▌ 
including missing persons; certain threats to the life or to the physical safety of natural 
persons or of a terrorist attack; and the localisation or identification of perpetrators or 
suspects of the criminal offences listed in an annex to this Regulation, where those 
criminal offences are punishable in the Member State concerned by a custodial sentence or 
a detention order for a maximum period of at least four years and as they are defined in the 
law of that Member State. Such a threshold for the custodial sentence or detention order in 
accordance with national law contributes to ensuring that the offence should be serious 
enough to potentially justify the use of ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification systems.",[],"{'question_type': 'vague', 'seed_document_id': 38, 'topic': 'Biometric Data and AI'}","Could you provide more context or specify the situation you're referring to?

harmonisation legislation. To ensure consistency and avoid unnecessary administrative 
burdens or costs, providers of a product that contains one or more high-risk AI systems, 
to which the requirements of this Regulation and of the Union harmonisation legislation 
listed in an annex to this Regulation apply, should have flexibility with regard to 
operational decisions on how to ensure compliance of a product that contains one or 
more AI systems with all applicable requirements of the Union harmonisation legislation 
in an optimal manner. AI systems identified as high-risk should be limited to those that 
have a significant harmful impact on the health, safety and fundamental rights of persons

The SIS is primarily a European initiative aimed at enhancing security and facilitating border control among Schengen Area countries, which are primarily European Union member states.

The SIS was designed to improve cooperation among member states in terms of security, law enforcement, and immigration control.

Regulation, such as banking or insurance entities, should carry out a fundamental 
rights impact assessment prior to putting it into use. Services important for individuals 
that are of public nature may also be provided by private entities. Private entities 
providing such public services are linked to tasks in the public interest such as in the 
areas of education, healthcare, social services, housing, administration of justice. The 
aim of the fundamental rights impact assessment is for the deployer to identify the 
specific risks to the rights of individuals or groups of individuals likely to be affected, 
identify measures to be taken in the case of a materialisation of those risks. The impact 
assessment should be performed prior to deploying the high-risk AI system, and should 
be updated when the deployer considers that any of the relevant factors have changed.

this assessment, the deployer should take into account information relevant to a proper 
assessment of the impact, including but not limited to the information given by the 
provider of the high-risk AI system in the instructions for use. In light of the risks 
identified, deployers should determine measures to be taken in the case of a 
materialisation of those risks, including for example governance arrangements in that 
specific context of use, such as arrangements for human oversight according to the 
instructions of use or, complaint handling and redress procedures, as they could be 
instrumental in mitigating risks to fundamental rights in concrete use-cases. After 
performing that impact assessment, the deployer should notify the relevant market 
surveillance authority. Where appropriate, to collect relevant information necessary to 
perform the impact assessment, deployers of high-risk AI system, in particular when AI 
systems are used in the public sector, could involve relevant stakeholders, including the 
representatives of groups of persons likely to be affected by the AI system, independent

The EU AI Act categorizes AI systems into different risk levels, with ""high-risk"" systems subject to stricter regulations. In the context of migration, asylum, and border control management, high-risk AI systems typically include:

1. **Biometric Identification Systems**: AI systems used for facial recognition or fingerprint analysis to identify individuals at borders or in asylum processes.

2. **Decision-Making Systems for Asylum Applications**: AI tools that assist in evaluating asylum claims, including risk assessments that determine the likelihood of an applicant's need for protection.

3. **Surveillance Systems**: AI technologies used for monitoring and analyzing data from surveillance cameras or drones at borders to detect unauthorized crossings or suspicious activities.

United in diversity
EN
(75)
Technical robustness is a key requirement for high-risk AI systems. They should be 
resilient in relation to harmful or otherwise undesirable behaviour that may result from 
limitations within the systems or the environment in which the systems operate (e.g. 
errors, faults, inconsistencies, unexpected situations). Therefore, technical and 
organisational measures should be taken to ensure robustness of high-risk AI systems, 
for example by designing and developing appropriate technical solutions to prevent or 
minimize harmful or otherwise undesirable behaviour. Those technical solution may 
include for instance mechanisms enabling the system to safely interrupt its operation 
(fail-safe plans) in the presence of certain anomalies or when operation takes place 
outside certain predetermined boundaries. Failure to protect against these risks could lead 
to safety impacts or negatively affect the fundamental rights, for example due to erroneous 
decisions or wrong or biased outputs generated by the AI system.
(76)
Cybersecurity plays a crucial role in ensuring that AI systems are resilient against attempts 
to alter their use, behaviour, performance or compromise their security properties by 
malicious third parties exploiting the system’s vulnerabilities. Cyberattacks against AI 
systems can leverage AI specific assets, such as training data sets (e.g. data poisoning) or 
trained models (e.g. adversarial attacks or membership inference), or exploit 
vulnerabilities in the AI system’s digital assets or the underlying ICT infrastructure. To 
ensure a level of cybersecurity appropriate to the risks, suitable measures, such as security 
controls, should therefore be taken by the providers of high-risk AI systems, also taking 
into account as appropriate the underlying ICT infrastructure.",[],"{'question_type': 'situational', 'seed_document_id': 84, 'situational_context': 'Amidst the labyrinth of regulations for high-risk AI systems, a legal consultant meticulously researches the EU AI Act to ensure compliance and safeguard fundamental rights against potential cybersecurity threats.', 'topic': 'High-Risk AI Systems'}","Navigating the regulations of high-risk AI systems under the EU AI Act requires a comprehensive approach to ensure compliance and robustness.

8. **Predictive Analytics**: AI can be used to predict future migration trends based on various factors, helping policymakers prepare for and respond to changing migration patterns.

### Compliance and Fundamental Rights Considerations

While these purposes can enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of migration and asylum management, they also raise important legal and ethical considerations:

- **Data Protection**: Compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is crucial, particularly regarding the collection, processing, and storage of personal data.

- **Non-Discrimination**: AI systems must be designed to avoid bias and discrimination, ensuring that all individuals are treated fairly regardless of their nationality, ethnicity, or other characteristics.

- **Transparency and Accountability**: There should be transparency in how AI systems operate, including the algorithms used and the data sources. This is essential for accountability and for individuals to understand how decisions affecting them are made.

- **Right to Appeal**: Individuals should have the right to appeal decisions made with the assistance of AI systems, ensuring that they can contest any adverse outcomes.

- **Human Oversight**: AI should complement, not replace, human decision-making, particularly in sensitive areas like asylum and migration, where individual circumstances must be carefully considered.

In summary, while AI systems can significantly enhance migration and asylum management, it is essential to ensure that their implementation aligns with EU regulations and upholds fundamental rights. This requires a careful balance between efficiency and the protection of individual rights.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed overview of various purposes of AI systems in migration and asylum management but does not specifically mention the key intended uses as outlined in the ground truth, such as assessing risks, assisting in application examinations, and detecting individuals.",0.3777777777777777,0.8898229598999023,5.0,"The generated answer comprehensively addresses the purposes of AI systems in migration, asylum, and border control management, aligns closely with the reference answer, and includes relevant considerations for compliance and fundamental rights without any factual inaccuracies."

What is the purpose of a fundamental rights impact assessment for high-risk AI systems and who is required to perform it?,"The purpose of the fundamental rights impact assessment is to identify specific risks to individuals' rights and measures to mitigate those risks, and it must be performed by deployers governed by public law, private entities providing public services, and those deploying certain high-risk AI systems listed in the Regulation.","Document 99: EN
United in diversity
EN
(96)
In order to efficiently ensure that fundamental rights are protected, deployers of high-
risk AI systems that are bodies governed by public law, or private entities providing 
public services and deployers of certain high-risk AI systems listed in an annex to this 
Regulation, such as banking or insurance entities, should carry out a fundamental 
rights impact assessment prior to putting it into use. Services important for individuals 
that are of public nature may also be provided by private entities. Private entities 
providing such public services are linked to tasks in the public interest such as in the 
areas of education, healthcare, social services, housing, administration of justice. The 
aim of the fundamental rights impact assessment is for the deployer to identify the 
specific risks to the rights of individuals or groups of individuals likely to be affected, 
identify measures to be taken in the case of a materialisation of those risks. The impact 
assessment should be performed prior to deploying the high-risk AI system, and should 
be updated when the deployer considers that any of the relevant factors have changed. 
The impact assessment should identify the deployer’s relevant processes in which the 
high-risk AI system will be used in line with its intended purpose, and should include a 
description of the period of time and frequency in which the system is intended to be 
used as well as of specific categories of natural persons and groups who are likely to be 
affected in the specific context of use.

Fundamental rights impact assessment for high-risk AI systems
1.
Prior to deploying a high-risk AI system referred to in Article 6(2), with the exception of 
high-risk AI systems intended to be used in the area listed in point 2 of Annex III, 
deployers that are bodies governed by public law, or are private entities providing public 
services, and deployers of high-risk AI systems referred to in points 5 (b) and (c) of 
Annex III, shall perform an assessment of the impact on fundamental rights that the use 
of such system may produce. For that purpose, deployers shall perform an assessment 
consisting of:
(a)
a description of the deployer’s processes in which the high-risk AI system will be 
used in line with its intended purpose;
(b)
a description of the period of time within which, and the frequency with which, 
each high-risk AI system is intended to be used;
(c)
the categories of natural persons and groups likely to be affected by its use in the 
specific context;

The assessment should also include the identification of specific risks of harm likely to 
have an impact on the fundamental rights of those persons or groups. While performing 
this assessment, the deployer should take into account information relevant to a proper 
assessment of the impact, including but not limited to the information given by the 
provider of the high-risk AI system in the instructions for use. In light of the risks 
identified, deployers should determine measures to be taken in the case of a 
materialisation of those risks, including for example governance arrangements in that 
specific context of use, such as arrangements for human oversight according to the 
instructions of use or, complaint handling and redress procedures, as they could be 
instrumental in mitigating risks to fundamental rights in concrete use-cases. After 
performing that impact assessment, the deployer should notify the relevant market 
surveillance authority. Where appropriate, to collect relevant information necessary to 
perform the impact assessment, deployers of high-risk AI system, in particular when AI 
systems are used in the public sector, could involve relevant stakeholders, including the 
representatives of groups of persons likely to be affected by the AI system, independent 
experts, and civil society organisations in conducting such impact assessments and

Here’s a breakdown of these considerations and the actions taken to address infringements:

### Factors Considered

1. **Legal Framework**: The primary legal basis for determining responsibility is found in the EU treaties, particularly Article 340 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which outlines the liability of the Union for damages caused by its institutions.

2. **Nature of the Infringement**: The type of infringement (e.g., failure to act, unlawful act, or breach of EU law) is crucial. The nature and severity of the infringement can influence the assessment of responsibility.

3. **Causation**: There must be a direct link between the action (or inaction) of the institution and the damage caused. This involves establishing that the infringement directly resulted in harm.

4. **Breach of Duty**: It must be demonstrated that the institution failed to fulfill its obligations under EU law. This could involve a violation of procedural rules, failure to comply with regulations, or neglecting duties.

5. **Proportionality and Reasonableness**: The actions of the institution are evaluated against the principles of proportionality and reasonableness. If the institution acted within a reasonable margin of discretion, it may not be held liable.

6. **Good Faith and Intent**: The intent behind the actions of the institution may also be considered. If the infringement was unintentional and the institution acted in good faith, this may mitigate responsibility.

### Actions Taken to Address Infringements

1. **Infringement Procedures**: The European Commission can initiate infringement procedures against member states or institutions for failing to comply with EU law. This process involves several stages, including:
   - **Preliminary Examination**: The Commission assesses the complaint or issue.
   - **Formal Notice**: If the issue is substantiated, a formal notice is sent to the member state or institution.
   - **Reasoned Opinion**: If the response is unsatisfactory, the Commission issues a reasoned opinion, outlining the infringement.
   - **Referral to the Court of Justice**: If the infringement persists, the case may be referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU).

2. **Judicial Review**: Institutions can be challenged in court for their actions or omissions. Individuals or member states can bring cases before the CJEU to seek redress for infringements.

3. **Compensation Claims**: If an infringement is established, affected parties may seek compensation for damages. This typically involves a claim for damages against the institution responsible for the infringement.

4. **Corrective Measures**: Institutions may be required to take corrective actions to remedy the infringement and prevent future occurrences. This could involve changes in procedures, policies, or practices.

5. **Public Accountability**: Infringements can lead to public scrutiny and accountability measures, including reports, recommendations, or reforms aimed at improving compliance with EU law.

6. **Policy Revisions**: In some cases, systemic issues leading to infringements may prompt broader policy reviews or legislative changes to prevent future violations.

By considering these factors and taking appropriate actions, the EU aims to uphold the rule of law and ensure that its institutions operate within the legal framework established by the treaties.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed explanation of the factors and actions related to the responsibility of EU institutions regarding infringements, but it does not address the specific focus on technical and organizational measures or actions taken to mitigate damage, which is central to the ground truth answer.",0.8928571428571429,0.0,5.0,"The generated answer comprehensively addresses all components of the user query regarding the factors of responsibility and actions taken for infringements, providing accurate and relevant information without any errors."

Here are the key points regarding the CE marking for high-risk AI systems:

### Requirements for CE Marking:

1. **Conformity Assessment**: High-risk AI systems must undergo a conformity assessment to ensure they meet the essential requirements outlined in the AI Act. This may involve:
   - Internal checks by the manufacturer.
   - Involvement of a notified body for more complex systems.

2. **Technical Documentation**: Manufacturers must prepare and maintain comprehensive technical documentation that demonstrates compliance. This includes:
   - Descriptions of the AI system.
   - Risk assessments.
   - Testing results.
   - User instructions.

3. **Risk Management**: A robust risk management process must be in place, identifying potential risks associated with the AI system and outlining mitigation strategies.

4. **Post-Market Monitoring**: Manufacturers are required to implement a post-market monitoring system to track the performance and safety of the AI system after it has been placed on the market.

5. **Quality Management System**: A quality management system (QMS) may be necessary to ensure ongoing compliance and quality assurance.

### Affixing the CE Marking:

1. **Placement**: The CE marking must be affixed visibly, legibly, and indelibly to the AI system or its packaging, or in the accompanying documentation.

2. **Format**: The CE marking must be in a specific format, which includes the letters ""CE"" in a standardized design. The height of the marking must be at least 5 mm, although it can be larger depending on the product.

3. **Manufacturer's Information**: Alongside the CE marking, the manufacturer's name and address should be included, ensuring traceability.

4. **Declaration of Conformity**: A Declaration of Conformity must be drawn up, stating that the AI system meets all relevant requirements of the AI Act and other applicable EU legislation.

"What is a 'remote biometric identification system' as defined in the Regulation, and how do 'real-time' systems differ from 'post' systems in biometric identification?","A 'remote biometric identification system' is an AI system for identifying individuals without their active involvement by comparing biometric data to a reference database, while 'real-time' systems perform capturing, comparison, and identification instantaneously, unlike 'post' systems which involve a delay after data capture.","Document 17: EN
United in diversity
EN
(17)
The notion of ‘remote biometric identification system’ referred to in this Regulation should 
be defined functionally, as an AI system intended for the identification of natural persons 
without their active involvement, typically at a distance, through the comparison of a 
person’s biometric data with the biometric data contained in a reference database, 
irrespectively of the particular technology, processes or types of biometric data used. 
Such remote biometric identification systems are typically used to perceive multiple 
persons or their behaviour simultaneously in order to facilitate significantly the 
identification of natural persons without their active involvement. This excludes AI 
systems intended to be used for biometric verification, which includes authentication, the 
sole purpose of which is to confirm that a specific natural person is the person he or she 
claims to be and to confirm the identity of a natural person for the sole purpose of 
having access to a service, unlocking a device or having security access to premises. 
That exclusion is justified by the fact that such systems are likely to have a minor impact 
on fundamental rights of natural persons compared to the remote biometric 
identification systems which may be used for the processing of the biometric data of a 
large number of persons without their active involvement. In the case of ‘real-time’ 
systems, the capturing of the biometric data, the comparison and the identification occur all 
instantaneously, near-instantaneously or in any event without a significant delay. In this 
regard, there should be no scope for circumventing the rules of this Regulation on the ‘real-
time’ use of the AI systems concerned by providing for minor delays. ‘Real-time’ systems 
involve the use of ‘live’ or ‘near-live’ material, such as video footage, generated by a 
camera or other device with similar functionality. In the case of ‘post’ systems, in contrast, 
the biometric data has already been captured and the comparison and identification occur 
only after a significant delay. This involves material, such as pictures or video footage 
generated by closed circuit television cameras or private devices, which has been generated 
before the use of the system in respect of the natural persons concerned.",[],"{'question_type': 'double', 'original_questions': [{'question': ""What is a 'remote biometric identification system' as defined in the Regulation?"", 'answer': ""A 'remote biometric identification system' is an AI system intended for the identification of natural persons without their active involvement, typically at a distance, through the comparison of a person’s biometric data with the biometric data contained in a reference database.""}, {'question': ""How do 'real-time' systems differ from 'post' systems in biometric identification?"", 'answer': ""'Real-time' systems involve the capturing of biometric data, comparison, and identification occurring all instantaneously or near-instantaneously, while 'post' systems involve biometric data that has already been captured, with comparison and identification occurring only after a significant delay.""}], 'seed_document_id': 17, 'topic': 'Biometric Data and AI'}","A **remote biometric identification system** is defined in regulations as a technology that uses biometric data (like facial recognition, fingerprints, or iris scans) to identify individuals from a distance, without their direct involvement or consent. This system typically captures biometric data through cameras or sensors and compares it against a database to identify or verify a person's identity.

### Differences Between 'Real-Time' and 'Post' Systems:

1. **Real-Time Systems**:
   - **Functionality**: These systems identify individuals as they are captured in live scenarios, such as surveillance cameras monitoring public spaces.
   - **Use Case**: Often used for immediate identification, such as in security checks at airports or monitoring crowds for known threats.
   - **Response Time**: Provides instant results, allowing for immediate action or intervention based on the identification.

2. **Post Systems**:
   - **Functionality**: These systems analyze biometric data after the fact, meaning they process recorded footage or data rather than live feeds.
   - **Use Case**: Commonly used for investigations, such as reviewing footage from a crime scene to identify suspects after an incident has occurred.
   - **Response Time**: Results are not immediate; they depend on the time taken to analyze the data after it has been collected.

"What is the purpose of the fundamental rights impact assessment for high-risk AI systems, and who is required to perform it?","The purpose of the fundamental rights impact assessment is to identify specific risks to individuals' rights and necessary measures to mitigate those risks, and it must be performed by deployers governed by public law, private entities providing public services, and certain high-risk AI system deployers like banking or insurance entities.","Document 100: EN
United in diversity

The assessment should also include the identification of specific risks of harm likely to 
have an impact on the fundamental rights of those persons or groups. While performing 
this assessment, the deployer should take into account information relevant to a proper 
assessment of the impact, including but not limited to the information given by the 
provider of the high-risk AI system in the instructions for use. In light of the risks 
identified, deployers should determine measures to be taken in the case of a 
materialisation of those risks, including for example governance arrangements in that 
specific context of use, such as arrangements for human oversight according to the 
instructions of use or, complaint handling and redress procedures, as they could be 
instrumental in mitigating risks to fundamental rights in concrete use-cases. After 
performing that impact assessment, the deployer should notify the relevant market 
surveillance authority. Where appropriate, to collect relevant information necessary to 
perform the impact assessment, deployers of high-risk AI system, in particular when AI 
systems are used in the public sector, could involve relevant stakeholders, including the 
representatives of groups of persons likely to be affected by the AI system, independent 
experts, and civil society organisations in conducting such impact assessments and 
designing measures to be taken in the case of materialisation of the risks. The European 
Artificial Intelligence Office (AI Office) should develop a template for a questionnaire in 
order to facilitate compliance and reduce the administrative burden for deployers.

risk AI systems that are bodies governed by public law, or private entities providing 
public services and deployers of certain high-risk AI systems listed in an annex to this 
Regulation, such as banking or insurance entities, should carry out a fundamental 
rights impact assessment prior to putting it into use. Services important for individuals 
that are of public nature may also be provided by private entities. Private entities 
providing such public services are linked to tasks in the public interest such as in the 
areas of education, healthcare, social services, housing, administration of justice. The 
aim of the fundamental rights impact assessment is for the deployer to identify the 
specific risks to the rights of individuals or groups of individuals likely to be affected, 
identify measures to be taken in the case of a materialisation of those risks. The impact 
assessment should be performed prior to deploying the high-risk AI system, and should 
be updated when the deployer considers that any of the relevant factors have changed. 
The impact assessment should identify the deployer’s relevant processes in which the 
high-risk AI system will be used in line with its intended purpose, and should include a 
description of the period of time and frequency in which the system is intended to be 
used as well as of specific categories of natural persons and groups who are likely to be 
affected in the specific context of use.

(35)
Each use of a ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification system in publicly accessible 
spaces for the purpose of law enforcement should be subject to an express and specific 
authorisation by a judicial authority or by an independent administrative authority of a 
Member State whose decision is binding. Such authorisation should, in principle, be 
obtained prior to the use of the AI system with a view to identifying a person or persons. 
Exceptions to that rule should be allowed in duly justified situations on grounds of 
urgency, namely in situations where the need to use the systems concerned is such as to 
make it effectively and objectively impossible to obtain an authorisation before 
commencing the use of the AI system. In such situations of urgency, the use of the AI 
system should be restricted to the absolute minimum necessary and should be subject to 
appropriate safeguards and conditions, as determined in national law and specified in the 
context of each individual urgent use case by the law enforcement authority itself. In 
addition, the law enforcement authority should in such situations request such 
authorisation ▌ while providing the reasons for not having been able to request it earlier, 
without undue delay and at the latest within 24 hours. If such an authorisation is 
rejected, the use of real-time biometric identification systems linked to that authorisation 
should cease with immediate effect and all the data related to such use should be 
discarded and deleted. Such data includes input data directly acquired by an AI system 
in the course of the use of such system as well as the results and outputs of the use 
linked to that authorisation. It should not include input that is legally acquired in 
accordance with another Union or national law. In any case, no decision producing an 
adverse legal effect on a person should be taken based solely on the output of the remote

authority or ▌ an independent administrative authority whose decision is binding of the 
Member State in which the use is to take place, issued upon a reasoned request and in 
accordance with the detailed rules of national law referred to in paragraph 5. However, in a 
duly justified situation of urgency, the use of such system may be commenced without an

The use of AI systems for real-time remote biometric identification of natural persons in 
publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement necessarily involves the 
processing of biometric data. The rules of this Regulation that prohibit, subject to certain 
exceptions, such use, which are based on Article 16 TFEU, should apply as lex specialis in 
respect of the rules on the processing of biometric data contained in Article 10 of Directive 
(EU) 2016/680, thus regulating such use and the processing of biometric data involved in 
an exhaustive manner. Therefore, such use and processing should be possible only in as far 
as it is compatible with the framework set by this Regulation, without there being scope, 
outside that framework, for the competent authorities, where they act for purpose of law 
enforcement, to use such systems and process such data in connection thereto on the 
grounds listed in Article 10 of Directive (EU) 2016/680. In that context, this Regulation is 
not intended to provide the legal basis for the processing of personal data under Article 8 
of Directive (EU) 2016/680. However, the use of real-time remote biometric identification 
systems in publicly accessible spaces for purposes other than law enforcement, including 
by competent authorities, should not be covered by the specific framework regarding such 
use for the purpose of law enforcement set by this Regulation. Such use for purposes other 
than law enforcement should therefore not be subject to the requirement of an authorisation 
under this Regulation and the applicable detailed rules of national law that may give effect 
to that authorisation.

The use of AI systems for ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification of natural persons in 
publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement is particularly intrusive to 
the rights and freedoms of the concerned persons, to the extent that it may affect the 
private life of a large part of the population, evoke a feeling of constant surveillance and 
indirectly dissuade the exercise of the freedom of assembly and other fundamental rights. 
Technical inaccuracies of AI systems intended for the remote biometric identification of 
natural persons can lead to biased results and entail discriminatory effects. Such 
possible biased results and discriminatory effects are particularly relevant with regard to 
age, ethnicity, race, sex or disabilities. In addition, the immediacy of the impact and the 
limited opportunities for further checks or corrections in relation to the use of such systems 
operating in real-time carry heightened risks for the rights and freedoms of the persons 
concerned in the context of, or impacted by, law enforcement activities.
(33)
The use of those systems for the purpose of law enforcement should therefore be 
prohibited, except in exhaustively listed and narrowly defined situations, where the use is 
strictly necessary to achieve a substantial public interest, the importance of which 
outweighs the risks. Those situations involve the search for certain victims of crime ▌ 
including missing persons; certain threats to the life or to the physical safety of natural 
persons or of a terrorist attack; and the localisation or identification of perpetrators or 
suspects of the criminal offences listed in an annex to this Regulation, where those 
criminal offences are punishable in the Member State concerned by a custodial sentence or 
a detention order for a maximum period of at least four years and as they are defined in the 
law of that Member State. Such a threshold for the custodial sentence or detention order in

enough to potentially justify the use of ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification systems.",[],"{'question_type': 'double', 'original_questions': [{'question': ""What is required for the use of a 'real-time' remote biometric identification system in publicly accessible spaces for law enforcement purposes?"", 'answer': 'Each use should be subject to an express and specific authorisation by a judicial authority or by an independent administrative authority of a Member State, whose decision is binding.'}, {'question': 'What are the potential risks associated with the use of AI systems for real-time remote biometric identification?', 'answer': 'The use of such systems is particularly intrusive to the rights and freedoms of concerned persons, potentially affecting private life, evoking a feeling of constant surveillance, and leading to biased results and discriminatory effects.'}], 'seed_document_id': 38, 'topic': 'Biometric Data and AI'}","The use of a 'real-time' remote biometric identification system in publicly accessible spaces for law enforcement involves several requirements and potential risks. Here’s a breakdown:

### Requirements:

1. **Legal Framework**:
   - **Legislation**: Clear laws governing the use of biometric data, including privacy protections and data retention policies.
   - **Regulatory Compliance**: Adherence to data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR in Europe, CCPA in California).

   - **Accountability Measures**: Mechanisms for oversight and accountability, including audits and public reporting.

5. **Technical Standards**:
   - **Accuracy and Reliability**: Systems must meet established standards for accuracy to minimize false positives and negatives.
   - **Interoperability**: Ability to integrate with existing law enforcement databases and systems.

### Potential Risks:

1. **Privacy Concerns**:
   - **Surveillance**: Continuous monitoring can lead to a loss of privacy and create a chilling effect on free expression and assembly.
   - **Data Misuse**: Risk of biometric data being used for purposes beyond law enforcement, such as profiling or discrimination.

2. **Bias and Discrimination**:
   - **Algorithmic Bias**: Biometric systems may have higher error rates for certain demographic groups, leading to disproportionate targeting of minorities.
   - **False Positives**: Misidentification can result in wrongful accusations or detentions.

3. **Security Risks**:
   - **Data Breaches**: Biometric data, once compromised, cannot be changed like passwords, leading to long-term security risks.
   - **Hacking**: Vulnerabilities in the system could be exploited by malicious actors.

4. **Erosion of Trust**:
   - **Public Backlash**: If perceived as invasive or discriminatory, the use of biometric systems can erode trust between law enforcement and communities.
   - **Social Division**: Increased surveillance may exacerbate tensions between different community groups.

5. **Legal Challenges**:
   - **Litigation**: Potential for lawsuits related to privacy violations, wrongful arrests, or misuse of data.
   - **Regulatory Scrutiny**: Increased oversight and regulation could limit the use of such technologies.

Here are some key areas of resilience and types of attacks that technical solutions should address:

### Areas of Resilience

1. **Adversarial Attacks**: These involve inputs specifically designed to deceive the AI model, leading to incorrect outputs. Resilience against adversarial examples is crucial.

2. **Data Poisoning**: Attackers may manipulate the training data to compromise the model's integrity. Systems should be able to detect and mitigate the effects of poisoned data.

3. **Model Inversion**: This type of attack allows adversaries to infer sensitive information about the training data by querying the model. Techniques like differential privacy can help mitigate this risk.

4. **Evasion Attacks**: These occur when an attacker modifies input data to evade detection or mislead the AI system. Robustness against such modifications is essential.

5. **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Attackers may overwhelm the system with requests, causing it to become unresponsive. Systems should have mechanisms to handle high loads and maintain availability.

6. **Insider Threats**: Employees or contractors with access to the system may exploit their privileges. Access controls and monitoring can help mitigate this risk.

7. **Model Theft**: Attackers may attempt to replicate or steal the model through various means, including querying it extensively. Techniques like watermarking can help protect intellectual property.

8. **Bias and Fairness Attacks**: Adversaries may exploit biases in the model to produce unfair or discriminatory outcomes. Continuous monitoring and auditing for fairness are necessary.

9. **Supply Chain Attacks**: Vulnerabilities in the software or hardware supply chain can compromise the integrity of the AI system. Ensuring secure development practices and supply chain transparency is vital.

### Types of Attacks to Address

1. **Adversarial Examples**: Implementing adversarial training, input preprocessing, and robust model architectures.

2. **Data Poisoning**: Using anomaly detection techniques to identify and filter out suspicious data points during training.

3. **Evasion Attacks**: Developing models that are robust to small perturbations in input data and employing ensemble methods.

4. **Model Inversion**: Applying differential privacy techniques to limit the amount of information that can be extracted from the model.

5. **Denial of Service**: Implementing rate limiting, load balancing, and redundancy to ensure service availability.

6. **Insider Threats**: Enforcing strict access controls, logging, and monitoring user activities to detect unusual behavior.

7. **Model Theft**: Using techniques like model watermarking and API rate limiting to protect against unauthorized access.

8. **Bias and Fairness**: Regularly auditing models for bias and implementing fairness-aware algorithms.

9. **Supply Chain Attacks**: Conducting thorough security assessments of third-party components and maintaining a secure development lifecycle.

1.
Where a market surveillance authority has sufficient reason to consider that an AI 
system classified by the provider as non-high-risk pursuant to Article 6(3) is indeed 
high-risk, the market surveillance authority shall carry out an evaluation of the AI 
system concerned in respect of its classification as a high-risk AI system based on the 
conditions set out in Article 6(3) and the Commission guidelines.

Where, in the course of that evaluation, the market surveillance authority finds that the 
AI system concerned is high-risk, it shall without undue delay require the relevant 
provider to take all necessary actions to bring the AI system into compliance with the 
requirements and obligations laid down in this Regulation, as well as take appropriate 
corrective action within a period the market surveillance authority may prescribe.

1. **Reclassification**: The authority may reclassify the AI system as high-risk, which would subject it to stricter regulatory requirements.

2. **Compliance Orders**: The authority can issue compliance orders requiring the organization to meet specific regulatory standards, including risk assessments, documentation, and transparency measures.

3. **Fines and Penalties**: If the organization is found to be in violation of regulations, the authority may impose fines or other financial penalties.

4. **Suspension of Use**: The authority may temporarily suspend the use of the AI system until compliance is achieved or until a thorough risk assessment is conducted.

5. **Mandatory Audits**: The organization may be required to undergo regular audits to ensure ongoing compliance with high-risk standards.

6. **Public Disclosure**: In some cases, the authority may require public disclosure of the risks associated with the AI system, which can impact the organization’s reputation.

7. **Collaboration with Other Authorities**: The market surveillance authority may collaborate with other regulatory bodies to ensure comprehensive oversight and enforcement.

8. **Guidance and Support**: The authority may provide guidance to help the organization understand the requirements for high-risk AI systems and how to achieve compliance.

1. **National Regulatory Authorities**: Many countries establish specific agencies or bodies responsible for overseeing AI systems. These authorities may have the power to enforce compliance with regulations, conduct audits, and impose penalties for violations.

2. **Data Protection Authorities**: Given the sensitive nature of data used in law enforcement, data protection authorities (like the GDPR authorities in the EU) play a crucial role in ensuring that AI systems comply with data privacy laws.

3. **Law Enforcement Agencies**: These agencies may have internal oversight bodies to ensure that AI tools used in policing are compliant with legal standards and ethical guidelines.

4. **Ethics Committees**: Some jurisdictions may establish ethics boards or committees to review the deployment of AI systems in law enforcement, ensuring they align with ethical standards and human rights considerations.

5. **Judicial Oversight**: Courts may be involved in reviewing the legality of AI applications in law enforcement, particularly regarding issues of due process and civil rights.

6. **Consumer Protection Agencies**: In some cases, these agencies may also have a role in overseeing the deployment of AI systems to ensure they do not harm consumers or the public.

7. **International Bodies**: Organizations like the European Union or the United Nations may set guidelines or frameworks that member states are encouraged to follow regarding the use of AI in sensitive areas.

8. **Technical Standards Organizations**: Bodies that develop technical standards for AI systems may also play a role in ensuring that these systems are safe and reliable.

The specific powers granted to these authorities can vary widely by jurisdiction but often include the ability to:

- Conduct audits and inspections of AI systems.
- Require transparency in AI algorithms and decision-making processes.
- Impose fines or sanctions for non-compliance.
- Mandate the implementation of corrective measures.
- Engage in public consultations and stakeholder engagement.

As regards stand-alone AI systems, namely high-risk AI systems other than those that are 
safety components of products, or that are themselves products, it is appropriate to classify 
them as high-risk if, in light of their intended purpose, they pose a high risk of harm to the 
health and safety or the fundamental rights of persons, taking into account both the severity 
of the possible harm and its probability of occurrence and they are used in a number of 
specifically pre-defined areas specified in this Regulation. The identification of those 
systems is based on the same methodology and criteria envisaged also for any future 
amendments of the list of high-risk AI systems that the Commission should be 
empowered to adopt, via delegated acts, to take into account the rapid pace of 
technological development, as well as the potential changes in the use of AI systems.

As regards AI systems that are safety components of products, or which are themselves 
products, falling within the scope of certain Union harmonisation legislation listed in an 
annex to this Regulation, it is appropriate to classify them as high-risk under this 
Regulation if the product concerned undergoes the conformity assessment procedure with a 
third-party conformity assessment body pursuant to that relevant Union harmonisation 
legislation. In particular, such products are machinery, toys, lifts, equipment and protective 
systems intended for use in potentially explosive atmospheres, radio equipment, pressure 
equipment, recreational craft equipment, cableway installations, appliances burning 
gaseous fuels, medical devices, in vitro diagnostic medical devices, automotive and 
aviation.

Classification rules for high-risk AI systems
1.
Irrespective of whether an AI system is placed on the market or put into service 
independently of the products referred to in points (a) and (b), that AI system shall be 
considered to be high-risk where both of the following conditions are fulfilled:
(a)
the AI system is intended to be used as a safety component of a product, or the AI 
system is itself a product, covered by the Union harmonisation legislation listed in 
Annex I;
(b)
the product whose safety component pursuant to point (a) is the AI system, or the

Here are the key criteria:

1. **Intended Purpose**: The AI system's intended use must be in areas that significantly impact people's safety, health, or fundamental rights. This includes sectors like healthcare, transportation, and law enforcement.

2. **Risk to Rights and Freedoms**: If the AI system poses a risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals, particularly in sensitive areas such as biometric identification, credit scoring, or employment decisions, it may be classified as high-risk.

3. **Sector of Application**: Certain sectors are inherently considered high-risk, such as:
   - Critical infrastructure (e.g., energy, transport)
   - Education and vocational training
   - Employment and worker management
   - Essential private and public services
   - Law enforcement and judicial systems

4. **Impact on Vulnerable Groups**: AI systems that affect vulnerable populations (e.g., children, disabled individuals) are more likely to be classified as high-risk due to the potential for greater harm.

5. **Complexity and Autonomy**: The more complex and autonomous the AI system is, the higher the risk it may pose. Systems that make decisions without human intervention or that learn and adapt over time are scrutinized more closely.

6. **Data Usage**: The type and sensitivity of data used by the AI system can also influence its risk classification. Systems that process personal data, especially sensitive data, are considered higher risk.

7. **Potential for Misuse**: If there is a significant potential for the AI system to be misused or to cause harm, it may be classified as high-risk.

8. **Compliance with Standards**: High-risk AI systems must comply with specific requirements, including risk management, data governance, transparency, and human oversight.

These factors help determine whether an AI system requires stricter regulatory oversight to mitigate potential risks to individuals and society.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed explanation of factors for classifying AI systems as high-risk under the EU AI Act, but it does not directly address the specific criteria mentioned in the ground truth answer regarding safety components and third-party conformity assessments.",0.0,0.471820205450058,5.0,"The generated answer comprehensively addresses the user query by detailing multiple specific factors involved in classifying an AI system as high-risk, aligning closely with the reference answer."

be defined functionally, as an AI system intended for the identification of natural persons 
without their active involvement, typically at a distance, through the comparison of a 
person’s biometric data with the biometric data contained in a reference database, 
irrespectively of the particular technology, processes or types of biometric data used. 
Such remote biometric identification systems are typically used to perceive multiple 
persons or their behaviour simultaneously in order to facilitate significantly the 
identification of natural persons without their active involvement. This excludes AI 
systems intended to be used for biometric verification, which includes authentication, the 
sole purpose of which is to confirm that a specific natural person is the person he or she 
claims to be and to confirm the identity of a natural person for the sole purpose of 
having access to a service, unlocking a device or having security access to premises. 
That exclusion is justified by the fact that such systems are likely to have a minor impact 
on fundamental rights of natural persons compared to the remote biometric 
identification systems which may be used for the processing of the biometric data of a 
large number of persons without their active involvement. In the case of ‘real-time’ 
systems, the capturing of the biometric data, the comparison and the identification occur all 
instantaneously, near-instantaneously or in any event without a significant delay. In this 
regard, there should be no scope for circumventing the rules of this Regulation on the ‘real-
time’ use of the AI systems concerned by providing for minor delays. ‘Real-time’ systems 
involve the use of ‘live’ or ‘near-live’ material, such as video footage, generated by a 
camera or other device with similar functionality. In the case of ‘post’ systems, in contrast, 
the biometric data has already been captured and the comparison and identification occur 
only after a significant delay. This involves material, such as pictures or video footage 
generated by closed circuit television cameras or private devices, which has been generated 
before the use of the system in respect of the natural persons concerned.","[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'I am looking to understand what distinguishes remote biometric identification systems from biometric verification systems according to the Regulation.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'How can I help you with that?'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'What are the differences?'}]","{'question_type': 'conversational', 'seed_document_id': 17, 'topic': 'Biometric Data and AI'}","Remote biometric identification systems and biometric verification systems differ primarily in their purpose and functionality. Here are the key distinctions:

### 1. **Purpose:**
   - **Remote Biometric Identification:**
     - Used to identify individuals from a distance without their explicit consent.
     - Typically involves matching biometric data (like facial recognition) against a database to find a match.
   - **Biometric Verification:**
     - Used to confirm the identity of an individual who is presenting their biometric data.
     - Involves a one-to-one comparison (e.g., comparing a fingerprint to a stored fingerprint) to verify that the person is who they claim to be.

### 2. **Consent:**
   - **Remote Biometric Identification:**
     - Often operates without the individual's knowledge or consent, raising privacy concerns.
   - **Biometric Verification:**
     - Generally requires the individual's consent, as they are actively participating in the verification process.

### 3. **Data Handling:**
   - **Remote Biometric Identification:**
     - Involves processing biometric data in real-time against a large database, which can include multiple individuals.
   - **Biometric Verification:**
     - Involves processing biometric data against a specific individual's stored data, usually in a controlled environment.

### 4. **Use Cases:**
   - **Remote Biometric Identification:**
     - Commonly used in surveillance, law enforcement, and public safety applications.
   - **Biometric Verification:**
     - Commonly used in secure access systems, such as unlocking devices, banking, and border control.

### 5. **Regulatory Considerations:**
   - **Remote Biometric Identification:**
     - Often subject to stricter regulations due to privacy implications and potential for misuse.
   - **Biometric Verification:**
     - While still regulated, it may have more lenient requirements since it typically involves user consent.

Aside from the many beneficial uses of AI, it can also be misused and provide novel and 
powerful tools for manipulative, exploitative and social control practices. Such practices 
are particularly harmful and abusive and should be prohibited because they contradict

AI-enabled manipulative techniques can be used to persuade persons to engage in 
unwanted behaviours, or to deceive them by nudging them into decisions in a way that 
subverts and impairs their autonomy, decision-making and free choices. The placing on 
the market, the putting into service or the use of certain AI systems with the objective to or 
the effect of materially distorting human behaviour, whereby significant harms, in 
particular having sufficiently important adverse impacts on physical, psychological 
health or financial interests are likely to occur, are particularly dangerous and should 
therefore be prohibited. Such AI systems deploy subliminal components such as audio, 
image, video stimuli that persons cannot perceive, as those stimuli are beyond human 
perception, or other manipulative or deceptive techniques that subvert or impair person’s 
autonomy, decision-making or free choice in ways that people are not consciously aware 
of those techniques or, where they are aware of them, can still be deceived or are not 
able to control or resist them. This could be facilitated, for example, by machine-brain 
interfaces or virtual reality as they allow for a higher degree of control of what stimuli 
are presented to persons, insofar as they may materially distort their behaviour in a 
significantly harmful manner. In addition, AI systems may also otherwise exploit the 
vulnerabilities of a person or a specific group of persons due to their age, disability within 
the meaning of Directive (EU) 2019/882 of the European Parliament and of the 
Council16, or a specific social or economic situation that is likely to make those persons
