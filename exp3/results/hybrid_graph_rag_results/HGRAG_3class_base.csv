New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection 
 
Notice of Adoption of Final Rule 
 
Pursuant to the authority vested in the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection by 
Sections 1043 and 2203(f) of the New York City Charter and Section 20-104(b) of the New York City 
Administrative Code, and in accordance with the requirements of Section 1043 of the New York City Charter, 
the Department amends Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York.  
 
An initial version of this rule was proposed and published on September 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on 
November 4, 2022, and comments regarding the rule were received. DCWP proposed a second version of this 
rule on December 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on January 23, 2023, and comments regarding the rule 
were received.  
 
Statement of Basis and Purpose 
 
The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP” or “Department”) is adding rules to implement 
new legislation regarding automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”). Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits 
employers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has 
been subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly 
available, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   
 
These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

employment position by submitting the necessary information or items in the format required by the 
employer or employment agency.  
 
Category. “Category” means any component 1 category required to be reported by employers pursuant

Historical data.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex_situational', 'seed_document_id': 0, 'topic': 'Requirements'}","Certainly! An automated employment decision tool (AEDT) is defined as any computational process, derived from machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence, that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation, that is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons. 

Before using an AEDT, employers and employment agencies in New York City must ensure that the tool has been subject to a bias audit within one year of use, and that information about the bias audit is publicly available. Additionally, employers and employment agencies must provide notice to candidates for employment at least 10 business days before using an AEDT, either on their website, in a job posting, or via U.S. mail or email. The notice must include instructions for how an individual can request an alternative selection process or a reasonable accommodation under other laws, if available. 

Employers and employment agencies must also make certain information publicly available on their website, including the date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios for all categories. The distribution date of the AEDT must also be provided. 

Finally, employers and employment agencies must keep the summary of results and distribution date posted for at least 6 months after its latest use of the AEDT for an employment decision.",False,"The agent's answer is overly detailed and includes additional requirements that are not explicitly stated in the ground truth, such as the specifics about the information that must be publicly available and the instructions for requesting an alternative selection process. While the core definition and some conditions are correct, the extra details diverge from the ground truth.",1.0,1.0,0.8447951078414917,0.9999999999857144,5.0,"The generated answer accurately defines an automated employment decision tool and comprehensively outlines the conditions that must be met before using it, aligning closely with the reference answer without any factual errors."
"In the context of a bias audit, what is the definition of 'test data' and when can it be used?",'Test data' refers to data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.,"Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

This includes processes derived from machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.

If you want to use an AEDT, there are several conditions that must be met. First, you must conduct a bias audit of the AEDT using test data. The audit must be conducted by an independent auditor who is not involved in using, developing, or distributing the AEDT and who has no employment relationship with your company or with a vendor that developed or distributes the AEDT.

Second, you must make the results of the bias audit publicly available on the employment section of your website in a clear and conspicuous manner. This includes the date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which must include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios for all categories. You must also provide the distribution date of the AEDT.

Third, you must provide notice to candidates for employment at least 10 business days before using the AEDT. This notice can be provided on the employment section of your website, in a job posting, or via U.S. mail or email.

Finally, you must keep the summary of results and distribution date posted for at least 6 months after the latest use of the AEDT for an employment decision.

      1.   Such tool has been the subject of a bias audit conducted no more than one year prior to the use of such tool; and

   b.   Notices required.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex_situational', 'seed_document_id': 23, 'topic': 'Metrics/Data'}","Certainly! A bias audit is an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor of an automated employment decision tool (AEDT) to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of federal regulations. 

In simpler terms, a bias audit is a way to ensure that an AEDT is not unfairly discriminating against certain groups of people based on their race, ethnicity, or sex. The audit calculates the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compares the selection rates to the most selected category to determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures.

The purpose of requiring a bias audit is to promote fairness and equity in the hiring process and to prevent discrimination against protected groups. By conducting a bias audit, employers can ensure that their AEDT is not perpetuating biases or unfairly excluding qualified candidates based on their race, ethnicity, or sex. It is important to note that the bias audit must be conducted no more than one year prior to the use of the AEDT, and a summary of the results of the most recent bias audit must be made publicly available on the website of the employer or employment agency prior to the use of the AEDT.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed explanation of what a bias audit entails and its purpose, but it does not directly match the ground truth answer, which specifically states the purpose of a bias audit without the additional context.",1.0,0.6956521739130435,0.8435371518135071,0.99999999998,5.0,"The generated answer is completely correct, addressing all components of the user query accurately and providing additional relevant information without any errors."
I'm reviewing a policy document and came across the term 'Impact Ratio.' Can you explain what it means and how it is calculated?,"The 'Impact Ratio' can be calculated as either the selection rate for a category divided by the selection rate of the most selected category, or the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the highest scoring category.","Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

financial interest in an employer or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to 
use the  AEDT or in a vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT. 
 
Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.

Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or

In the context of the policy document you are reviewing, the Impact Ratio refers to a measure of the potential impact of an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT) on different categories of candidates for employment. The Impact Ratio is calculated separately for each category, such as sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race.

To calculate the Impact Ratio, the policy document specifies that the following steps should be taken:

1. Calculate the selection rate for each category.
2. Calculate the scoring rate for individuals in each category.
3. Calculate the impact ratio for each category.

The selection rate is the percentage of candidates in a particular category who are selected for employment or promotion. The scoring rate is the average score received by candidates in a particular category on the AEDT. The impact ratio is calculated by dividing the selection rate for a particular category by the selection rate for the reference group (e.g., the selection rate for all candidates).

The Impact Ratio is used to identify potential bias in the AEDT and to ensure that the tool is not having a disproportionate impact on certain categories of candidates.

New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection 
 
Notice of Adoption of Final Rule 
 
Pursuant to the authority vested in the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection by 
Sections 1043 and 2203(f) of the New York City Charter and Section 20-104(b) of the New York City 
Administrative Code, and in accordance with the requirements of Section 1043 of the New York City Charter, 
the Department amends Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York.  
 
An initial version of this rule was proposed and published on September 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on 
November 4, 2022, and comments regarding the rule were received. DCWP proposed a second version of this 
rule on December 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on January 23, 2023, and comments regarding the rule 
were received.  
 
Statement of Basis and Purpose 
 
The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP” or “Department”) is adding rules to implement 
new legislation regarding automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”). Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits 
employers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has 
been subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly 
available, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   
 
These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

This includes processes derived from machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.

Examples of AEDTs include algorithms used to screen job applicants, assess employee performance, or determine promotions. These tools can be used to analyze large amounts of data and provide recommendations or decisions based on that data. However, the use of AEDTs can also lead to unintended biases and discrimination, which is why the New York City Administrative Code requires employers and employment agencies to conduct bias audits of AEDTs and make the results publicly available. Additionally, employers and employment agencies must provide notices to employees and job candidates about the use of AEDTs and the job qualifications and characteristics that the tool will use in the assessment of candidates or employees.",False,"The agent's definition of an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT) is partially correct but does not fully align with the ground truth.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

In the context of AEDTs in New York City, a 'Bias Audit' is an impartial evaluation of an AEDT conducted by an independent auditor. The purpose of the audit is to assess the AEDT's disparate impact on individuals of any component 1 category required to be reported by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of federal regulations. 

The audit must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures.

The bias audit must be conducted by an independent auditor. The regulations do not specify who can be considered an independent auditor, but it is generally understood to mean a third-party entity that is not affiliated with the employer or the AEDT vendor.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex_situational', 'seed_document_id': 6, 'topic': 'Definitions'}","Yes, as an employer planning to use an AEDT for screening resumes and scheduling interviews, you must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT is conducted no more than a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application process.

The bias audit must, at a minimum, calculate the selection rate for each category and the impact ratio for each category. The calculations required in the bias audit must separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates), race/ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American female candidates).

If the AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles), the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of the bias audit must be performed for each group.

The bias audit must also indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required calculations because they fall within an unknown category.

It is important to note that an independent auditor must conduct the bias audit, and the auditor may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT.",True,,1.0,1.0,0.841393768787384,0.9999999999857144,4.0,"The generated answer correctly addresses the requirements for conducting a bias audit of an AEDT, including the calculation of impact ratios for various categories, but it includes some extraneous details that do not directly pertain to the core requirements."
I have been using an AEDT for 6 months and need to conduct a bias audit. Can I rely on my own historical data or do I need to provide data from other employers?,"A bias audit of an AEDT must, at a minimum, calculate the selection rate and impact ratio for each category, separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race, perform the calculations for each group if the AEDT classifies candidates into specified groups, and indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT that are not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category.","Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category.

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job

Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the

For example, to calculate the impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates, you would divide the selection rate of male candidates by the selection rate of female candidates. 

The policy document requires that the Impact Ratio be calculated separately for each category, and that the calculations be performed for each group if the AEDT classifies candidates into specified groups.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and,

What information does the bias audit summary need to include?,"The bias audit summary needs to include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios for all categories.","Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Section 1.  Chapter 5 of Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York is amended to add Subchapter T to read 
as follows: 
Subchapter T: Automated Employment Decision Tools 
§ 5-300. Definitions. 
As used in this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings: 
 
Automated Employment Decision Tool. “Automated employment decision tool” or “AEDT” means 
“Automated employment decision tool” as defined by § 20-870 of the Code where the phrase “to 
substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making” means: 
i. 
to rely solely on a simplified output (score, tag, classification, ranking, etc.), with no other 
factors considered; or 
ii. 
 to use a simplified output as one of a set of criteria where the simplified output is weighted 
more than any other criterion in the set; or   
iii. 
to use a simplified output to overrule conclusions derived from other factors including 
human decision-making.  
  
Bias Audit. “Bias audit” means “Bias audit” as defined by § 20-870 of the Code.  
 
Candidate for Employment. “Candidate for employment” means a person who has applied for a specific 
employment position by submitting the necessary information or items in the format required by the 
employer or employment agency.  
 
Category. “Category” means any component 1 category required to be reported by employers pursuant 
to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States Code as specified in part 1602.7 of 
title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, as designated on the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission Employer Information Report EEO-1. 
 
Code. “Code” means the Administrative Code of the City of New York. 
 
Distribution Date. “Distribution date” means the date the employer or employment agency began using 
a specific AEDT.  
 
Employment Decision. “Employment decision” means “Employment decision” as defined by § 20-870 
of the Code. 
 
Employment Agency. “Employment agency” means “Employment agency” as defined by 6 RCNY § 5-
249.

What must a bias audit of an AEDT calculate?,"A bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate and impact ratio for each category, including sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race. It must also indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT that fall within an unknown category.","Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

at any point during the bias audit, has a direct financial interest or a material indirect 
financial interest in an employer or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to 
use the  AEDT or in a vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT. 
 
Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.  
 
 
 
    _________selection rate for a category________  
Impact Ratio =        selection rate of the most selected category  
 
OR 
 
  
 
     ______scoring rate for a category__________  
Impact Ratio =        scoring rate of the highest scoring category 
 
 
Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 


New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection 
 
Notice of Adoption of Final Rule 
 
Pursuant to the authority vested in the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection by 
Sections 1043 and 2203(f) of the New York City Charter and Section 20-104(b) of the New York City 
Administrative Code, and in accordance with the requirements of Section 1043 of the New York City Charter, 
the Department amends Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York.  
 
An initial version of this rule was proposed and published on September 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on 
November 4, 2022, and comments regarding the rule were received. DCWP proposed a second version of this 
rule on December 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on January 23, 2023, and comments regarding the rule 
were received.  
 
Statement of Basis and Purpose 
 
The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP” or “Department”) is adding rules to implement 
new legislation regarding automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”). Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits 
employers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has 
been subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly 
available, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   
 
These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.

separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino

calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT.

employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'simple', 'seed_document_id': 15, 'topic': 'Metrics/Data', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","The bias audit for an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT) must calculate the impact ratio for each category, which is either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the highest scoring category. The impact ratio must be separately calculated for sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;",[],"{'question_type': 'simple', 'seed_document_id': 14, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","According to section 5-301 of the law, a bias audit of an AEDT must, at a minimum:

4. Ensure that the calculations in (1), (2), and (3) are performed for each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion into specified groups;
5. Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required calculations because they fall within an unknown category.

may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT.

Document 0: Subchapter 25: Automated Employment Decision Tools
§ 20-870 Definitions.
For the purposes of this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings:
   Automated employment decision tool. The term ""automated employment decision tool"" means any computational process, derived from machine
learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence, that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation,
that is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons. The term
""automated employment decision tool"" does not include a tool that does not automate, support, substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-
making processes and that does not materially impact natural persons, including, but not limited to, a junk email filter, firewall, antivirus software,
calculator, spreadsheet, database, data set, or other compilation of data.
   Bias audit. The term ""bias audit"" means an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor. Such bias audit shall include but not be limited to the
testing of an automated employment decision tool to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported
by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of
federal regulations.
   Employment decision. The term ""employment decision"" means to screen candidates for employment or employees for promotion within the city.
(L.L. 2021/144, 12/11/2021, eff. 1/1/2023)
§ 20-871 Requirements for automated employment decision tools.
   a.   In the city, it shall be unlawful for an employer or an employment agency to use an automated employment decision tool to screen a candidate or
employee for an employment decision unless:
      1.   Such tool has been the subject of a bias audit conducted no more than one year prior to the use of such tool; and
      2.   A summary of the results of the most recent bias audit of such tool as well as the distribution date of the tool to which such audit applies has been
made publicly available on the website of the employer or employment agency prior to the use of such tool.
   b.   Notices required.",[],"{'question_type': 'simple', 'seed_document_id': 23, 'topic': 'Definitions', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","The purpose of a bias audit for automated employment decision tools (AEDTs) is to evaluate the potential impact of the tool on different categories of candidates, such as race/ethnicity and sex categories. The audit calculates the selection rate and impact ratio for each category and compares them to the most selected category to determine if there is a potential for bias. The audit is necessary to ensure that the AEDT is not unfairly discriminating against certain categories of candidates and to promote fair hiring practices. The audit must be conducted no more than one year before the planned use of the AEDT.",False,"The agent's answer focuses on evaluating the impact on different categories of candidates and mentions specific metrics like selection rate and impact ratio, while the ground truth emphasizes assessing disparate impact on required reporting categories. The agent's response is not aligned with the specific phrasing and focus of the ground truth.",1.0,0.75,0.9251343607902528,0.99999999998,4.0,"The generated answer correctly addresses the purpose of a bias audit for automated employment decision tools and provides relevant details, but it includes some extraneous information about the timing of the audit that is not essential to the core purpose."
What are the requirements for the published results of the bias audit?,The requirements for the published results of the required bias audit are clarified in the new rules. These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category that is required to be reported to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to determine an impact ratio.,"Document 9: 4 
 
iii. 
at any point during the bias audit, has a direct financial interest or a material indirect 
financial interest in an employer or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to 
use the  AEDT or in a vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT. 
 
Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.  
 
 
 
    _________selection rate for a category________  
Impact Ratio =        selection rate of the most selected category  
 
OR 
 
  
 
     ______scoring rate for a category__________  
Impact Ratio =        scoring rate of the highest scoring category 
 
 
Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;",[],"{'question_type': 'simple', 'seed_document_id': 9, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","According to section 5-303(a) of the Chapter, before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex', 'seed_document_id': 11, 'topic': 'Metrics/Data', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","According to the rules outlined in section § 5-301 and § 5-303 of the New York City Administrative Code, a bias audit of an AEDT must meet the following requirements:

1. Calculate the selection rate for each category, including sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race.

2. Calculate the impact ratio for each category, which is the selection rate for a category divided by the selection rate of the most selected category.

3. Ensure that the calculations separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race.

4. If an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion into specified groups, ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) are performed for each group.

5. Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required calculations because they fall within an unknown category.

In addition, the rules specify that an employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT. The rules also clarify that historical data from an employer or employment agency's use of an AEDT can be used for a bias audit, but test data cannot be used on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If an employer or employment agency wants to rely on a bias audit using historical data from other employers or employment agencies, it must provide its own historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The rules also provide specific requirements for publishing the results of the bias audit and providing notices to employees and candidates for employment.",False,"The agent's answer provides excessive detail and includes additional information not present in the ground truth, such as specific sections of the New York City Administrative Code and conditions regarding the use of historical and test data. The ground truth focuses on the minimum requirements without the extra context.",1.0,1.0,0.8013041019439697,0.9999999999857144,5.0,"The generated answer comprehensively addresses all components of the user query, providing accurate calculations and requirements for conducting a bias audit of an AEDT, along with relevant conditions for data usage."
What is the definition of 'Impact Ratio' and how is it calculated in relation to the selection rate or scoring rate of different categories?,"The 'Impact Ratio' can be calculated either as the selection rate for a category divided by the selection rate of the most selected category, or as the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the highest scoring category.","Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

financial interest in an employer or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to 
use the  AEDT or in a vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT. 
 
Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.

Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii.

What is the difference between historical data and test data in the context of conducting a bias audit for an AEDT?,'Test data' refers to data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.,"Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection 
 
Notice of Adoption of Final Rule 
 
Pursuant to the authority vested in the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection by 
Sections 1043 and 2203(f) of the New York City Charter and Section 20-104(b) of the New York City 
Administrative Code, and in accordance with the requirements of Section 1043 of the New York City Charter, 
the Department amends Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York.  
 
An initial version of this rule was proposed and published on September 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on 
November 4, 2022, and comments regarding the rule were received. DCWP proposed a second version of this 
rule on December 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on January 23, 2023, and comments regarding the rule 
were received.  
 
Statement of Basis and Purpose 
 
The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP” or “Department”) is adding rules to implement 
new legislation regarding automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”). Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits 
employers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has 
been subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly 
available, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   
 
These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

Document 7: 3 
 
Section 1.  Chapter 5 of Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York is amended to add Subchapter T to read 
as follows: 
Subchapter T: Automated Employment Decision Tools 
§ 5-300. Definitions. 
As used in this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings: 
 
Automated Employment Decision Tool. “Automated employment decision tool” or “AEDT” means 
“Automated employment decision tool” as defined by § 20-870 of the Code where the phrase “to 
substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making” means: 
i. 
to rely solely on a simplified output (score, tag, classification, ranking, etc.), with no other 
factors considered; or 
ii. 
 to use a simplified output as one of a set of criteria where the simplified output is weighted 
more than any other criterion in the set; or   
iii. 
to use a simplified output to overrule conclusions derived from other factors including 
human decision-making.  
  
Bias Audit. “Bias audit” means “Bias audit” as defined by § 20-870 of the Code.  
 
Candidate for Employment. “Candidate for employment” means a person who has applied for a specific 
employment position by submitting the necessary information or items in the format required by the 
employer or employment agency.  
 
Category. “Category” means any component 1 category required to be reported by employers pursuant 
to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States Code as specified in part 1602.7 of 
title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, as designated on the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission Employer Information Report EEO-1. 
 
Code. “Code” means the Administrative Code of the City of New York.

This evaluation includes testing an automated employment decision tool to assess the impact of the tool on natural persons. The purpose of a bias audit is to identify and address any potential biases or discrimination that may be present in the tool's algorithms or data sets. The audit is conducted by an independent auditor who is capable of exercising objective and impartial judgment on all issues within the scope of the audit.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor's justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex', 'seed_document_id': 15, 'topic': 'Metrics/Data', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","According to the rules outlined in the legal document, a bias audit of an AEDT must include the following steps and criteria:

1. Calculate the selection rate for each category.
2. Calculate the impact ratio for each category.
3. Ensure that the calculations required in steps 1 and 2 separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on:
   i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates)
   ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates)
   iii. Intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American female candidates).
4. Ensure that the calculations in steps 1, 2, and 3 are performed for each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles).
5. Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required calculations because they fall within an unknown category.

The impact ratio is calculated by dividing the selection rate for a category by the selection rate of the most selected category. The impact ratio is used to determine whether the AEDT has a disparate impact on certain categories of individuals.

The categories for which impact ratios must be calculated include sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race. The impact ratios must be separately calculated for each of these categories.

In addition, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion into specified groups, the calculations in steps 1, 2, and 3 must be performed for each group.

The bias audit must be conducted no more than one year before the planned use of the AEDT. The results of the bias audit must be published and made publicly available.

What information does an employer or employment agency need to make publicly available before using an AEDT?,"Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency must make publicly available on the employment section of their website the date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results. The summary should include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT that fall within an unknown category, and the number of applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios for all categories.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and,

to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of
the code of federal regulations.
Employment decision. The term “employment decision” means to screen candidates for employment or
employees for promotion within the city.
§ 20-871 Requirements for automated employment decision tools. a. In the city, it shall be unlawful for
an employer or an employment agency to use an automated employment decision tool to screen a candidate or
employee for an employment decision unless:
1. Such tool has been the subject of a bias audit conducted no more than one year prior to the use of
such tool; and
2. A summary of the results of the most recent bias audit of such tool as well as the distribution date of
the tool to which such audit applies has been made publicly available on the website of the employer or
employment agency prior to the use of such tool.

employment decision tool to screen an employee or a candidate who has applied for a position for an
employment decision shall notify each such employee or candidate who resides in the city of the following:
1. That an automated employment decision tool will be used in connection with the assessment or
evaluation of such employee or candidate that resides in the city. Such notice shall be made no less than ten
business days before such use and allow a candidate to request an alternative selection process or
accommodation;
2. The job qualifications and characteristics that such automated employment decision tool will use in

""automated employment decision tool"" does not include a tool that does not automate, support, substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-
making processes and that does not materially impact natural persons, including, but not limited to, a junk email filter, firewall, antivirus software,
calculator, spreadsheet, database, data set, or other compilation of data.
   Bias audit. The term ""bias audit"" means an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor. Such bias audit shall include but not be limited to the
testing of an automated employment decision tool to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported
by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of
federal regulations.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex', 'seed_document_id': 13, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","According to the text, an AEDT (Automated Employment Decision Tool) is subject to a bias audit, which must calculate the selection rate and impact ratio for each category of sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race. The bias audit must be conducted at least once a year, and the employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has passed since the most recent bias audit. 

Under certain circumstances, an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit using test data. For example, if an employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months and does not have sufficient data to conduct a statistically significant bias audit, it may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration.

§ 20-870 Definitions.
For the purposes of this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings:
   Automated employment decision tool. The term ""automated employment decision tool"" means any computational process, derived from machine
learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence, that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation,

"What are the specific calculations and requirements that must be performed during a bias audit of an AEDT for selection rates, impact ratios, and categories of sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectionality?","A bias audit of an AEDT must, at a minimum, calculate the selection rate for each category, calculate the impact ratio for each category, ensure that the calculations separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories, and indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT that are not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category.","Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Document 6: 2 
 
 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include:

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection 
 
Notice of Adoption of Final Rule 
 
Pursuant to the authority vested in the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection by 
Sections 1043 and 2203(f) of the New York City Charter and Section 20-104(b) of the New York City 
Administrative Code, and in accordance with the requirements of Section 1043 of the New York City Charter, 
the Department amends Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York.  
 
An initial version of this rule was proposed and published on September 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on 
November 4, 2022, and comments regarding the rule were received. DCWP proposed a second version of this 
rule on December 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on January 23, 2023, and comments regarding the rule 
were received.  
 
Statement of Basis and Purpose 
 
The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP” or “Department”) is adding rules to implement 
new legislation regarding automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”). Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits 
employers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has 
been subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly 
available, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   
 
These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

Section 1.  Chapter 5 of Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York is amended to add Subchapter T to read 
as follows: 
Subchapter T: Automated Employment Decision Tools 
§ 5-300. Definitions. 
As used in this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings: 
 
Automated Employment Decision Tool. “Automated employment decision tool” or “AEDT” means 
“Automated employment decision tool” as defined by § 20-870 of the Code where the phrase “to 
substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making” means: 
i. 
to rely solely on a simplified output (score, tag, classification, ranking, etc.), with no other 
factors considered; or 
ii. 
 to use a simplified output as one of a set of criteria where the simplified output is weighted 
more than any other criterion in the set; or   
iii. 
to use a simplified output to overrule conclusions derived from other factors including 
human decision-making.  
  
Bias Audit. “Bias audit” means “Bias audit” as defined by § 20-870 of the Code.  
 
Candidate for Employment. “Candidate for employment” means a person who has applied for a specific 
employment position by submitting the necessary information or items in the format required by the 
employer or employment agency.  
 
Category. “Category” means any component 1 category required to be reported by employers pursuant 
to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States Code as specified in part 1602.7 of 
title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, as designated on the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission Employer Information Report EEO-1. 
 
Code. “Code” means the Administrative Code of the City of New York. 
 
Distribution Date. “Distribution date” means the date the employer or employment agency began using 
a specific AEDT.  
 
Employment Decision. “Employment decision” means “Employment decision” as defined by § 20-870 
of the Code. 
 
Employment Agency. “Employment agency” means “Employment agency” as defined by 6 RCNY § 5-
249.  
 
Historical data.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex', 'seed_document_id': 4, 'topic': 'Definitions', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","In the context of automated employment decision tools, 'Bias Audit' means an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of federal regulations. The audit shall include testing of an automated employment decision tool.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed explanation of 'Bias Audit' but does not align with the ground truth, which specifies that it is defined by § 20-870 of the Code.",1.0,1.0,0.9667625427246094,0.999999999975,3.0,"The generated answer provides a detailed explanation of 'Bias Audit' but does not directly reference the specific definition as stated in the reference answer, leading to minor inaccuracies."
What is the distinction between historical data and test data in the context of conducting a bias audit for an AEDT?,Test data refers to data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.,"Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category.

What are the criteria and calculations required for conducting a bias audit on the published results of an AEDT?,The published results of a bias audit must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category required to be reported to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to determine an impact ratio.,"Document 9: 4 
 
iii. 
at any point during the bias audit, has a direct financial interest or a material indirect 
financial interest in an employer or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to 
use the  AEDT or in a vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT. 
 
Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.  
 
 
 
    _________selection rate for a category________  
Impact Ratio =        selection rate of the most selected category  
 
OR 
 
  
 
     ______scoring rate for a category__________  
Impact Ratio =        scoring rate of the highest scoring category 
 
 
Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;",[],"{'question_type': 'complex', 'seed_document_id': 9, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","According to Section 5-303 of the law, before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency must make the following publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:

2. The distribution date of the AEDT.

When an AEDT scores candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion, a bias audit must, at a minimum:

1. Calculate the median score for the full sample of applicants;
2. Calculate the scoring rate for individuals in each category;
3. Calculate the impact ratio for each category;
4. Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on:
   i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),
   ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and

Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT;

Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.

determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  


The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies;

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.

determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies;

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.

(1) Calculate the median score for the full sample of applicants;  
(2) Calculate the scoring rate for individuals in each category;

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and

the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;",[],"{'question_type': 'distracting element', 'seed_document_id': 14, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': 'Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job \nposting.

that is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons. The term
""automated employment decision tool"" does not include a tool that does not automate, support, substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-
making processes and that does not materially impact natural persons, including, but not limited to, a junk email filter, firewall, antivirus software,
calculator, spreadsheet, database, data set, or other compilation of data.
   Bias audit. The term ""bias audit"" means an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor. Such bias audit shall include but not be limited to the
testing of an automated employment decision tool to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported
by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of

Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and

the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  


The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer

Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.

Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.

(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.",[],"{'question_type': 'distracting element', 'seed_document_id': 6, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': '1 \n \nNew York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection \n \nNotice of Adoption of Final Rule \n \nPursuant to the authority vested in the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection by \nSections 1043 and 2203(f) of the New York City Charter and Section 20-104(b) of the New York City \nAdministrative Code, and in accordance with the requirements of Section 1043 of the New York City Charter, \nthe Department amends Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York.  \n \nAn initial version of this rule was proposed and published on September 23, 2022.

"I'm considering using an AEDT for the first time. Can I rely on a bias audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or can I conduct a bias audit using test data? What is the definition of 'test data' in the context of a bias audit?",'Test data' refers to data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.,"Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection 
 
Notice of Adoption of Final Rule 
 
Pursuant to the authority vested in the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection by 
Sections 1043 and 2203(f) of the New York City Charter and Section 20-104(b) of the New York City 
Administrative Code, and in accordance with the requirements of Section 1043 of the New York City Charter, 
the Department amends Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York.  
 
An initial version of this rule was proposed and published on September 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on 
November 4, 2022, and comments regarding the rule were received. DCWP proposed a second version of this 
rule on December 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on January 23, 2023, and comments regarding the rule 
were received.  
 
Statement of Basis and Purpose 
 
The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP” or “Department”) is adding rules to implement 
new legislation regarding automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”). Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits 
employers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has 
been subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly 
available, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   
 
These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

Can you explain the meaning of test data in the context of a bias audit according to Local Law 144 and other policy documents?,Test data refers to data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.,"Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT.

employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'situational', 'seed_document_id': 18, 'topic': 'Definitions', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': '{""description"": ""I am a legal chatbot for Local Law 144 and other policy documents.""}', 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","In the context of a bias audit according to Local Law 144 and other policy documents, test data refers to data that is used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.

If there is insufficient historical data available to conduct a statistically significant bias audit, an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data. However, the use of test data is subject to certain conditions and limitations. For example, an employer or employment agency may only rely on a bias audit that uses test data if they have provided historical data from their own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if they have never used the AEDT. 

Overall, the use of test data in a bias audit is intended to ensure that the AEDT is evaluated for potential bias even if there is not enough historical data available to conduct a comprehensive audit.",False,"The agent's answer is overly detailed and includes information beyond the simple definition provided in the ground truth.

Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum:

What are the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT according to Local Law 144 and other policy documents?,"A bias audit of an AEDT must, at a minimum, calculate the selection rate for each category, calculate the impact ratio for each category, ensure that the impact calculations are done separately for sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories, and indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT that are not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category.","Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Document 6: 2 
 
 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.  
 
 
 
    _________selection rate for a category________

     ______scoring rate for a category__________  
Impact Ratio =        scoring rate of the highest scoring category 
 
 
Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;",[],"{'question_type': 'situational', 'seed_document_id': 9, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': '{""question"": ""What is the purpose of the AEDT bias audit?""}', 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","According to Section 5-303 of the law, before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.

§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or

I'm reviewing policy documents related to bias audits and I'm seeking clarification on the definition of 'Impact Ratio'. Can you explain what 'Impact Ratio' means?,"The 'Impact Ratio' can be calculated as either the selection rate for a category divided by the selection rate of the most selected category, or the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the highest scoring category.","Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above

Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF

In the context of bias audits for AEDTs (Artificial Intelligence Employment Decision Tools), 'Impact Ratio' refers to a calculation that compares the selection rate or scoring rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category that is required to be reported to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to the selection rate or scoring rate of the most selected or highest scoring category. The resulting ratio is used to determine whether the AEDT has a disparate impact on certain protected categories. 

For example, if the selection rate for male candidates is 50% and the selection rate for female candidates is 40%, the impact ratio for the sex category would be 0.8 (40% divided by 50%). An impact ratio of 1.0 indicates no disparate impact, while a ratio below 1.0 indicates a potential disparate impact.

Notice of Adoption of Final Rule 
 
Pursuant to the authority vested in the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection by 
Sections 1043 and 2203(f) of the New York City Charter and Section 20-104(b) of the New York City 
Administrative Code, and in accordance with the requirements of Section 1043 of the New York City Charter, 
the Department amends Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York.  
 
An initial version of this rule was proposed and published on September 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on 
November 4, 2022, and comments regarding the rule were received. DCWP proposed a second version of this 
rule on December 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on January 23, 2023, and comments regarding the rule 
were received.  
 
Statement of Basis and Purpose 
 
The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP” or “Department”) is adding rules to implement 
new legislation regarding automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”). Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits 
employers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has 
been subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly 
available, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   
 
These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

""automated employment decision tool"" does not include a tool that does not automate, support, substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-
making processes and that does not materially impact natural persons, including, but not limited to, a junk email filter, firewall, antivirus software,
calculator, spreadsheet, database, data set, or other compilation of data.
   Bias audit. The term ""bias audit"" means an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor. Such bias audit shall include but not be limited to the
testing of an automated employment decision tool to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported
by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of
federal regulations.
   Employment decision. The term ""employment decision"" means to screen candidates for employment or employees for promotion within the city.

§ 20-872 Penalties.
   a.   Any person that violates any provision of this subchapter or any rule promulgated pursuant to this subchapter is liable for a civil penalty of not more
than $500 for a first violation and each additional violation occurring on the same day as the first violation, and not less than $500 nor more than $1,500

trials and hearings or within any agency of the city designated to conduct such proceedings.
(L.L. 2021/144, 12/11/2021, eff. 1/1/2023)
§ 20-873 Enforcement.
The corporation counsel or such other persons designated by the corporation counsel on behalf of the department may initiate in any court of competent
jurisdiction any action or proceeding that may be appropriate or necessary for correction of any violation issued pursuant this subchapter, including
mandating compliance with the provisions of this chapter or such other relief as may be appropriate.

What are the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT and what changes were made in the second version of the proposed rules?,"The requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT include calculating the selection rate and impact ratio for each category. In the second version of the proposed rules, changes were made to the definition of AEDT and the requirements for an independent auditor were clarified.","Document 14: Data 
on those individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
(c) Where an AEDT scores candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion, a bias 
audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the median score for the full sample of applicants;  
(2) Calculate the scoring rate for individuals in each category;

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;",[],"{'question_type': 'double', 'seed_document_id': 14, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': [{'question': 'What are the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT?', 'answer': 'An employer or employment agency must calculate the selection rate for each category and the impact ratio for each category.'}, {'question': 'What changes were made in the second version of the proposed rules?', 'answer': 'The changes included modifying the definition of AEDT and clarifying the requirements for an independent auditor.'}], 'fake_fact': None}","According to the context information, the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT are as follows:

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results.

What are the requirements for a bias audit and what is test data in the context of a bias audit?,The requirements for a bias audit include calculating the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category and comparing the selection rates to determine an impact ratio. Test data in the context of a bias audit refers to data used to conduct the audit that is not historical data.,"Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Document 6: 2 
 
 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.

rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit.

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency

that is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons. The term
""automated employment decision tool"" does not include a tool that does not automate, support, substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-
making processes and that does not materially impact natural persons, including, but not limited to, a junk email filter, firewall, antivirus software,
calculator, spreadsheet, database, data set, or other compilation of data.
   Bias audit. The term ""bias audit"" means an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor. Such bias audit shall include but not be limited to the
testing of an automated employment decision tool to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported
by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.

What are the requirements for a bias audit and what is test data?,The requirements for a bias audit include calculating the selection rate and impact ratio for each category. Test data is the data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.,"Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Document 6: 2 
 
 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

“Shall” and “must” denote mandatory requirements and may be used interchangeably in the rules of this 
department, unless otherwise specified or unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;

Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.

For the purposes of this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings:
   Automated employment decision tool. The term ""automated employment decision tool"" means any computational process, derived from machine
learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence, that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation,
that is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons. The term
""automated employment decision tool"" does not include a tool that does not automate, support, substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-
making processes and that does not materially impact natural persons, including, but not limited to, a junk email filter, firewall, antivirus software,
calculator, spreadsheet, database, data set, or other compilation of data.
   Bias audit. The term ""bias audit"" means an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor. Such bias audit shall include but not be limited to the
testing of an automated employment decision tool to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported
by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of
federal regulations.

The requirements for using an automated employment decision tool are as follows:

1. The tool must have been subject to a bias audit conducted no more than one year prior to its use.
2. A summary of the results of the most recent bias audit of the tool, as well as the distribution date of the tool to which the audit applies, must be made publicly available on the website of the employer or employment agency prior to the use of the tool.
3. The employer or employment agency must notify each employee or candidate who resides in the city that an automated employment decision tool will be used in connection with their assessment or evaluation, and provide information about the job qualifications and characteristics that the tool will use in the assessment. This notice must be made no less than 10 business days before the use of the tool, and allow the candidate to request an alternative selection process or accommodation.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed definition of 'employment decision' and lists the requirements for using an automated employment decision tool, but it omits the key point that it is unlawful to use such a tool without a bias audit and public summary.

What are the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT and what is test data?,The requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT are to calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category and compare the selection rates to determine an impact ratio. Test data is data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.,"Document 6: 2 
 
 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

[Deleted material is in brackets.] 
 
“Shall” and “must” denote mandatory requirements and may be used interchangeably in the rules of this 
department, unless otherwise specified or unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.

What is the purpose of a bias audit and under what circumstances can an employer rely on it using historical data from other employers?,The purpose of a bias audit is to calculate the impact ratio and selection rate of an AEDT on different categories. An employer can rely on a bias audit using historical data from other employers if they provided their own historical data or if they have never used the AEDT.,"Document 17: 8

§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job

(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.

What is the relationship between the definition of 'test data' in a bias audit and the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT?,"In a bias audit, 'test data' refers to the data used for the audit that is not historical data. On the other hand, a bias audit of an AEDT requires calculating the selection rate and impact ratio for each category, including sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectional categories. Therefore, the definition of 'test data' in a bias audit is distinct from the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT, but both are crucial components of ensuring fairness and identifying potential biases in automated systems.","Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'compare', 'seed_document_id': 18, 'topic': 'Definitions', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': [{'question': ""What is the definition of 'test data' in relation to a bias audit?"", 'answer': ""'Test data' means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.""}, {'question': 'What are the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT?', 'answer': 'A bias audit must calculate the selection rate and impact ratio for each category, including sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectional categories.'}], 'fake_fact': None}","The definition of 'test data' in a bias audit is relevant to the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT because an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Section 1.  Chapter 5 of Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York is amended to add Subchapter T to read 
as follows: 
Subchapter T: Automated Employment Decision Tools 
§ 5-300. Definitions. 
As used in this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings: 
 
Automated Employment Decision Tool. “Automated employment decision tool” or “AEDT” means 
“Automated employment decision tool” as defined by § 20-870 of the Code where the phrase “to 
substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making” means: 
i. 
to rely solely on a simplified output (score, tag, classification, ranking, etc.), with no other 
factors considered; or 
ii. 
 to use a simplified output as one of a set of criteria where the simplified output is weighted 
more than any other criterion in the set; or   
iii. 
to use a simplified output to overrule conclusions derived from other factors including 
human decision-making.  
  
Bias Audit. “Bias audit” means “Bias audit” as defined by § 20-870 of the Code.  
 
Candidate for Employment. “Candidate for employment” means a person who has applied for a specific 
employment position by submitting the necessary information or items in the format required by the 
employer or employment agency.  
 
Category. “Category” means any component 1 category required to be reported by employers pursuant 
to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States Code as specified in part 1602.7 of 
title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, as designated on the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission Employer Information Report EEO-1. 
 
Code. “Code” means the Administrative Code of the City of New York. 
 
Distribution Date. “Distribution date” means the date the employer or employment agency began using 
a specific AEDT.  
 
Employment Decision. “Employment decision” means “Employment decision” as defined by § 20-870 
of the Code. 
 
Employment Agency. “Employment agency” means “Employment agency” as defined by 6 RCNY § 5-
249.

The requirements for using an automated employment decision tool, as outlined in § 20-871 of the administrative code of the city of New York, include conducting a bias audit of the tool no more than one year prior to its use and making the results of the audit publicly available on the employer or employment agency's website. The definition of an automated employment decision tool, as defined in § 20-870 of the same code, specifies the characteristics of a tool that would be subject to these requirements. Therefore, the definition of an automated employment decision tool is directly related to the requirements for using such a tool.",False,The agent's answer does not accurately capture the definition of an automated employment decision tool and its relationship to the requirements. It focuses on the requirements but fails to provide the specific definition and the legal context as outlined in the ground truth.,1.0,1.0,0.816624104976654,0.99999999998,4.0,"The generated answer correctly addresses the relationship between the definition and requirements of an automated employment decision tool, providing accurate details, but it could be slightly clearer in distinguishing the general understanding from the legal requirements."
"What is the relationship between test data and the requirements for a bias audit, and how do they differ?","Test data refers to the data used specifically for conducting a bias audit, which is not historical data. On the other hand, the requirements for a bias audit include calculating the selection rate and impact ratio for various categories, such as sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectional categories. While test data is a subset of the data used in a bias audit, the requirements for a bias audit involve specific calculations and analysis of different categories to identify and address biases.","Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency

"What are the differences and similarities between 'selection rate' and 'scoring rate', and how do they relate to each other?","'Selection rate' refers to the rate at which individuals are selected or classified in a hiring process or by an AEDT, while 'scoring rate' pertains to the rate at which individuals receive a score above the sample's median score, calculated by an AEDT. Both rates involve evaluating individuals based on certain criteria, but 'selection rate' focuses on advancement in a process, while 'scoring rate' focuses on achieving a score above a threshold. In some cases, the two rates may be related, such as when a higher 'scoring rate' leads to a higher 'selection rate' for certain categories of individuals.","Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

financial interest in an employer or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to 
use the  AEDT or in a vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT. 
 
Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.

Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification.

Selection rate refers to the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. This rate is calculated by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.

Scoring rate, on the other hand, refers to the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT.

While selection rate and scoring rate are different measures, they are related in that the scoring rate can impact the selection rate. For example, if a particular category of candidates consistently receives lower scores from the AEDT, this could result in a lower selection rate for that category. 

Both measures are important in assessing potential bias in an AEDT, as they can reveal whether certain categories of candidates are being systematically excluded or disadvantaged by the tool.",True,,0.5,1.0,0.756975531578064,0.6388888888675925,4.0,"The generated answer correctly explains both 'selection rate' and 'scoring rate', addresses their differences and similarities, and relates them to each other, but it could be slightly more concise and focused on the core definitions."
What calculations are required in the bias audit and when can an independent auditor exclude a category from these calculations?,"In the bias audit, calculations include determining the impact ratio for each category and assessing the impact of the AEDT on various demographic categories. An independent auditor can exclude a category from the calculations if it represents less than 2% of the data being used for the audit.","Document 16: (d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

What is the relationship between the definition of test data and when an employer or employment agency can rely on a bias audit that uses test data?,"Test data is data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. An employer or employment agency can rely on a bias audit that uses test data if there is insufficient historical data available to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. In other words, test data serves as an alternative when historical data is lacking, allowing employers and employment agencies to still assess and address bias in their processes.","Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

On the other hand, the requirements for the published results of a bias audit involve providing notices to employees and candidates for employment, as well as clarifying other obligations for the employer or employment agency. While the calculations focus on analyzing the impact of bias, the requirements for publishing the results are concerned with ensuring transparency and compliance with legal obligations.","Document 14: Data

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT;

§ 20-870 Definitions.
For the purposes of this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings:
   Automated employment decision tool. The term ""automated employment decision tool"" means any computational process, derived from machine
learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence, that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation,

While both concepts involve making assessments, 'Scoring Rate' focuses on evaluating scores based on a median, while 'Screen' involves evaluating candidates for selection or promotion. They are related in the sense that both involve making judgments or decisions based on certain criteria, but they differ in terms of the specific context and method of assessment.","Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above

Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF

move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.

While 'Scoring Rate' is related to the actual scores assigned to individuals by an AEDT, 'Screen' is related to the decision-making process that follows the use of an AEDT.

What is the relationship between the requirements for a bias audit and the concept of test data?,"The requirements for a bias audit involve calculating selection rates for different demographic categories to determine an impact ratio. Test data, on the other hand, refers to the data used in a bias audit that is not historical data. Test data is necessary to conduct a bias audit and apply the requirements. In summary, the requirements for a bias audit rely on analyzing selection rates, while test data is the specific type of data used to perform the audit.","Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Document 6: 2 
 
 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.

§ 20-870 Definitions.
For the purposes of this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings:
   Automated employment decision tool. The term ""automated employment decision tool"" means any computational process, derived from machine
learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence, that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation,
that is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons. The term
""automated employment decision tool"" does not include a tool that does not automate, support, substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-
making processes and that does not materially impact natural persons, including, but not limited to, a junk email filter, firewall, antivirus software,
calculator, spreadsheet, database, data set, or other compilation of data.
   Bias audit. The term ""bias audit"" means an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor. Such bias audit shall include but not be limited to the
testing of an automated employment decision tool to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported
by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of
federal regulations.

Section 1.  Chapter 5 of Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York is amended to add Subchapter T to read 
as follows: 
Subchapter T: Automated Employment Decision Tools

As used in this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings: 
 
Automated Employment Decision Tool. “Automated employment decision tool” or “AEDT” means 
“Automated employment decision tool” as defined by § 20-870 of the Code where the phrase “to

factors considered; or 
ii. 
 to use a simplified output as one of a set of criteria where the simplified output is weighted 
more than any other criterion in the set; or   
iii. 
to use a simplified output to overrule conclusions derived from other factors including 
human decision-making.  
  
Bias Audit. “Bias audit” means “Bias audit” as defined by § 20-870 of the Code.  
 
Candidate for Employment. “Candidate for employment” means a person who has applied for a specific 
employment position by submitting the necessary information or items in the format required by the

Can the employer rely on a bias audit conducted using test data?,"No, the employer cannot rely on a bias audit conducted using test data. According to § 5-303, an employer may rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other employers or employment agencies, but not on a bias audit conducted using test data.","Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit. The vendor provides historical data regarding 
applicant selection that the vendor has collected from multiple employers to an independent auditor who 
will conduct a bias audit as follows:

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment

Is this exclusion allowed under the law?,"No, the exclusion of a category that represents less than 2% of the data used for the bias audit is not allowed under the law. The law requires that all categories be included in the calculations for impact ratio, regardless of their representation in the data.","Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT.

employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'rule_conclusion', 'seed_document_id': 15, 'topic': 'Enforcement and Penalties', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","Yes, the exclusion of a category representing less than 2% of the data used for the bias audit is allowed under the law.

Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.  
 
 
 
    _________selection rate for a category________

Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 


Additionally, an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 0: Subchapter 25: Automated Employment Decision Tools
§ 20-870 Definitions.
For the purposes of this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings:
   Automated employment decision tool. The term ""automated employment decision tool"" means any computational process, derived from machine
learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence, that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation,
that is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons. The term
""automated employment decision tool"" does not include a tool that does not automate, support, substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-
making processes and that does not materially impact natural persons, including, but not limited to, a junk email filter, firewall, antivirus software,
calculator, spreadsheet, database, data set, or other compilation of data.
   Bias audit. The term ""bias audit"" means an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor. Such bias audit shall include but not be limited to the
testing of an automated employment decision tool to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported
by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of
federal regulations.
   Employment decision. The term ""employment decision"" means to screen candidates for employment or employees for promotion within the city.

§ 20-871 Requirements for automated employment decision tools.
   a.   In the city, it shall be unlawful for an employer or an employment agency to use an automated employment decision tool to screen a candidate or
employee for an employment decision unless:
      1.   Such tool has been the subject of a bias audit conducted no more than one year prior to the use of such tool; and
      2.   A summary of the results of the most recent bias audit of such tool as well as the distribution date of the tool to which such audit applies has been
made publicly available on the website of the employer or employment agency prior to the use of such tool.
   b.   Notices required.

Document 2: The job qualifications and characteristics that such automated employment decision tool will use in the assessment of such candidate or
employee. Such notice shall be made no less than 10 business days before such use; and
      3.   If not disclosed on the employer or employment agency's website, information about the type of data collected for the automated employment
decision tool, the source of such data and the employer or employment agency's data retention policy shall be available upon written request by a
candidate or employee. Such information shall be provided within 30 days of the written request. Information pursuant to this section shall not be
disclosed where such disclosure would violate local, state, or federal law, or interfere with a law enforcement investigation.
(L.L. 2021/144, 12/11/2021, eff. 1/1/2023)
§ 20-872 Penalties.
   a.   Any person that violates any provision of this subchapter or any rule promulgated pursuant to this subchapter is liable for a civil penalty of not more
than $500 for a first violation and each additional violation occurring on the same day as the first violation, and not less than $500 nor more than $1,500
for each subsequent violation.
   b.   Each day on which an automated employment decision tool is used in violation of this section shall give rise to a separate violation of subdivision a
of section 20-871.
   c.   Failure to provide any notice to a candidate or an employee in violation of paragraphs 1, 2 or 3 of subdivision b of section 20-871 shall constitute a
separate violation.
   d.   A proceeding to recover any civil penalty authorized by this subchapter is returnable to any tribunal established within the office of administrative
trials and hearings or within any agency of the city designated to conduct such proceedings.
(L.L. 2021/144, 12/11/2021, eff. 1/1/2023)
§ 20-873 Enforcement.
The corporation counsel or such other persons designated by the corporation counsel on behalf of the department may initiate in any court of competent

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and

the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'rule_conclusion', 'seed_document_id': 15, 'topic': 'Metrics/Data', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","The employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT. Additionally, the bias audit must calculate the selection rate and impact ratio for each sex and race/ethnicity category, and indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required calculations because they fall within an unknown category. This information must be publicly available on the employer's website in a clear and conspicuous manner.",False,"The agent answer provides additional details beyond the ground truth, which only states that a bias audit must be conducted no more than a year before use.

What are the requirements for a bias audit of the AEDT?,"For an AEDT that selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion, a bias audit must calculate the selection rate and impact ratio for each category, including sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories. The bias audit must also indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT that are not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category.","Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Document 6: 2 
 
 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

Notice of Adoption of Final Rule 
 
Pursuant to the authority vested in the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection by 
Sections 1043 and 2203(f) of the New York City Charter and Section 20-104(b) of the New York City 
Administrative Code, and in accordance with the requirements of Section 1043 of the New York City Charter, 
the Department amends Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York.  
 
An initial version of this rule was proposed and published on September 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on 
November 4, 2022, and comments regarding the rule were received. DCWP proposed a second version of this 
rule on December 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on January 23, 2023, and comments regarding the rule 
were received.  
 
Statement of Basis and Purpose 
 
The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP” or “Department”) is adding rules to implement 
new legislation regarding automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”). Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits 
employers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has 
been subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly 
available, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   
 
These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.

audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.",[],"{'question_type': 'rule_conclusion', 'seed_document_id': 17, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","Yes, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the planned use of the AEDT, even if the employer is not using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application process.

separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of

(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'vague', 'seed_document_id': 15, 'topic': 'Metrics/Data', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","The required calculations depend on the specific context, but some examples from the text include:

- For a bias audit of an automated employment decision tool (AEDT) that scores candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion, the audit must at a minimum calculate the median score for the full sample of applicants and the scoring rate for individuals in each category (e.g. sex, race/ethnicity, intersectional categories).
- The bias audit must also separately calculate the impact ratio for each category (e.g. impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates, impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates, impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American female candidates).
- An independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio.
- Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency must make publicly available on their website the date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios for all categories.",False,"The agent's answer provides detailed examples of calculations but does not directly address the specific calculations required as outlined in the ground truth.

What should be in the summary?,"The summary of results of a bias audit should include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios for all categories.","Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.",[],"{'question_type': 'vague', 'seed_document_id': 17, 'topic': 'Definitions', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","The purpose of a bias audit is to assess the potential impact of an automated employment decision tool (AEDT) on different categories of individuals, such as those based on sex, race, ethnicity, and intersectional categories.

 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results. 
 
New material is underlined. 
[Deleted material is in brackets.] 
 
“Shall” and “must” denote mandatory requirements and may be used interchangeably in the rules of this 
department, unless otherwise specified or unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

The audit must be conducted no more than one year prior to the use of the AEDT and must include calculations of selection rates and impact ratios for each category, as well as separate calculations for intersectional categories.

What are the criteria for a bias audit?,"A bias audit of an AEDT must, at a minimum, calculate the selection rate for each category, calculate the impact ratio for each category, ensure that the calculations separately calculate the impact on sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories, and indicate the number of individuals not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category.","Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Document 6: 2 
 
 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.",[],"{'question_type': 'vague', 'seed_document_id': 5, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","According to the rules mentioned in the context, the criteria for a bias audit of an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT) are as follows:

3. The bias audit must compare the selection rates and scoring rates to the most selected category to determine an impact ratio.
4. If insufficient historical data is available, an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data.
5. The summary of results of the bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was generated and obtained.
6. An independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio.

(1) Calculate the median score for the full sample of applicants;  
(2) Calculate the scoring rate for individuals in each category;

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;",[],"{'question_type': 'vague', 'seed_document_id': 14, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","According to the rules outlined in the document, a bias audit of an AEDT must, at a minimum:

Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.

category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT. 
The employer provides historical data on “culture fit” score of applicants for each category to an 
independent auditor to conduct a bias audit as follows:

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'vague', 'seed_document_id': 15, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","There are several required calculations for a bias audit of an automated employment decision tool (AEDT) in the city of New York. These include:

- Calculating the median score for the full sample of applicants
- Calculating the scoring rate for individuals in each category
- Calculating the impact ratio for each category, separately comparing sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories
- Indicating the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category

These calculations must be conducted by an independent auditor as part of a bias audit of the AEDT. The results of the bias audit must be made publicly available on the employment section of the employer or employment agency's website.",False,"The agent's answer provides a detailed list of calculations required for a bias audit, but it does not specifically mention the impact ratio calculations as required in the ground truth answer.

What are the requirements for the results?,"The requirements for the published results of the bias audit include calculating the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and sex category, comparing the selection rates to the most selected category to determine an impact ratio, and reporting these calculations to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) as required by the EEO Component 1 report.","Document 9: 4 
 
iii. 
at any point during the bias audit, has a direct financial interest or a material indirect 
financial interest in an employer or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to 
use the  AEDT or in a vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT. 
 
Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.  
 
 
 
    _________selection rate for a category________  
Impact Ratio =        selection rate of the most selected category  
 
OR 
 
  
 
     ______scoring rate for a category__________  
Impact Ratio =        scoring rate of the highest scoring category 
 
 
Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate’s fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample’s median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate’s estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate’s resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;",[],"{'question_type': 'vague', 'seed_document_id': 9, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","According to § 5-303(a) of the law, before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 0: Subchapter 25: Automated Employment Decision Tools
§ 20-870 Definitions.
For the purposes of this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings:
   Automated employment decision tool. The term ""automated employment decision tool"" means any computational process, derived from machine

agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT.

The two answers address different aspects of the topic.",0.5,0.3,0.5387485027313232,0.4166666666458333,3.0,"The generated answer provides a detailed explanation of the purpose of conducting a bias audit but incorrectly defines AEDT as the Automated Employment Decision Tool instead of the Applicant Employment Data Template, leading to some factual inaccuracies."
What is the objective?,"The purpose of a bias audit for an AEDT is to calculate the selection rate and impact ratio for different categories, such as sex, race/ethnicity, and intersectional categories. It also ensures that the calculations are performed for each group if the AEDT classifies candidates into specified groups.","Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Here are some of the key requirements:

1. Definition: An AEDT is defined as any computational process, derived from machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence, that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation, that is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons.

2. Bias Audit: Employers and employment agencies that use AEDTs must conduct a bias audit to assess the impact of the tool on protected categories, such as race, gender, and age. The bias audit must be conducted by an independent auditor and must include, at a minimum, the calculation of the median score for the full sample of applicants and the scoring rate for individuals in each category.

3. Reporting: Employers and employment agencies must report on their use of AEDTs, including the name and version of the tool, the distribution date, and the categories of data used by the tool.

4. Impact Ratio: Employers and employment agencies must calculate an impact ratio for each protected category, which compares the selection rate for individuals in that category to the selection rate for individuals in the most favored category. The impact ratio must be less than 80% for each protected category.

5. Historical Data: Employers and employment agencies must provide historical data to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit, if available.

6. Recordkeeping: Employers and employment agencies must maintain records related to their use of AEDTs, including the results of the bias audit and any corrective actions taken in response to the audit.

sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Document 6: 2 
 
 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.","[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'I need to know the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'How can I help you with that?'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'What are they?'}]","{'question_type': 'conversational', 'seed_document_id': 5, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","According to the text, a bias audit of an Automated Employment Decision Tool (AEDT) must, at a minimum:

1. Calculate the median score for the full sample of applicants.
2. Calculate the scoring rate for individuals in each category.

Additionally, the text mentions that a bias audit should be conducted by an independent auditor and should include testing of the AEDT to assess the impact of any potential biases. The audit should also indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT who are not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and this number should be included in the summary of results. Finally, the audit should be conducted using historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies.",False,"The agent's answer does not accurately reflect the ground truth. It mentions calculating the median score and scoring rate, which are not part of the ground truth requirements. The ground truth specifies calculating the selection rate and impact ratio for each category, which the agent failed to include.",0.75,1.0,0.3492403924465179,0.9166666666361112,3.0,The generated answer partially addresses the components of the user query but includes incorrect information regarding the specific calculations required in a bias audit of an AEDT.
What is it called?,'Test data' refers to data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.,"Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category.

these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or

The test data is typically selected to represent a diverse range of individuals and scenarios, and is used to simulate the decision-making process of the AEDT in order to assess its accuracy and fairness. The results of the bias audit can then be used to identify and address any biases in the AEDT's decision-making process.",False,"The agent's answer provides an extensive explanation of 'test data' in the context of a bias audit, but it does not mention that it is specifically data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data, which is a key part of the ground truth.",0.0,0.1111111111111111,0.4528745412826538,0.19999999998,4.0,"The generated answer correctly identifies ""test data"" in the context of a bias audit and provides relevant details, but it could be more concise."

sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category.

(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.

2. The bias audit must evaluate the impact of the AEDT on natural persons, including any disparate impact on protected categories such as race, gender, and age.

3. The bias audit must assess the accuracy and validity of the AEDT's output, including any scoring, classification, or recommendation.

4. The bias audit must use appropriate data to evaluate the AEDT, which may include historical data, test data, or data from other employers or employment agencies.

5. The bias audit must calculate the impact ratio separately for sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories.

What is the definition?,'Test data' refers to data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data.,"Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data.

§ 20-871 Requirements for automated employment decision tools.
   a.   In the city, it shall be unlawful for an employer or an employment agency to use an automated employment decision tool to screen a candidate or
employee for an employment decision unless:
      1.   Such tool has been the subject of a bias audit conducted no more than one year prior to the use of such tool; and

The audit assesses the tool's accuracy, fairness, and reliability, and identifies any potential biases that may exist in the tool's algorithms or data inputs. The results of the audit are then used to make any necessary adjustments to the tool to ensure that it is fair and unbiased in its decision-making process.",False,The agent's answer provides a general overview of the purpose of a bias audit but does not specifically address the legal context and requirements outlined in the ground truth answer.,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.4716189503669739,0.9166666666361112,4.0,"The generated answer correctly addresses the purpose of a bias audit for automated employment decision tools and provides relevant details, but it lacks specific legal references mentioned in the reference answer."
What is the meaning of it?,'Test data' refers to data used in a bias audit that is not historical data.,"Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.","[{'role': 'user', 'content': ""I would like to know the definition of 'test data' in the context of a bias audit.""}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'How can I help you with that?'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'What is the meaning of it?'}]","{'question_type': 'conversational', 'seed_document_id': 18, 'topic': 'Definitions', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","In the context of a bias audit for an automated employment decision tool (AEDT), ""test data"" refers to data that is used to evaluate the performance of the AEDT in a controlled environment, rather than historical data collected during the actual use of the AEDT.

The audit assesses the tool's accuracy, fairness, and reliability, and identifies any potential biases that may exist in the tool's algorithms or data inputs. The results of the audit are then used to make any necessary adjustments to the tool to ensure that it is fair and unbiased in its decision-making process.",False,The agent's answer provides a general overview of the purpose of a bias audit but does not specifically address the legal context and requirements outlined in the ground truth answer.,1.0,0.4285714285714285,0.4716189503669739,0.94999999997625,4.0,"The generated answer correctly addresses the purpose of a bias audit for automated employment decision tools and provides relevant details, but it lacks specific legal references found in the reference answer."
What are the necessary details?,"A bias audit of an AEDT must, at a minimum, calculate the selection rate for each category, calculate the impact ratio for each category, separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on sex categories, race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories, and indicate the number of individuals assessed by the AEDT that are not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category.","Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Document 6: 2 
 
 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.","[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'I need to know the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'How can I help you with that?'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'What are the necessary details?'}]","{'question_type': 'conversational', 'seed_document_id': 5, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': None}","According to the New York City Administrative Code, the following are the requirements for a bias audit of an AEDT:

1. The audit must use historical data of the AEDT.
2. The historical data used may be from one or more employers or employment agencies that use the AEDT.
3. An individual employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment agencies only if it provided historical data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if it has never used the AEDT.
4. An employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.
5. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was generated and obtained.

What is the definition?,Bias audit means an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor. Such bias audit shall include but not be limited to the testing of an automated employment decision tool to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of federal regulations.,"Document 7: 3

New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection 
 
Notice of Adoption of Final Rule 
 
Pursuant to the authority vested in the Commissioner of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection by 
Sections 1043 and 2203(f) of the New York City Charter and Section 20-104(b) of the New York City 
Administrative Code, and in accordance with the requirements of Section 1043 of the New York City Charter, 
the Department amends Title 6 of the Rules of the City of New York.  
 
An initial version of this rule was proposed and published on September 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on 
November 4, 2022, and comments regarding the rule were received. DCWP proposed a second version of this 
rule on December 23, 2022. A public hearing was held on January 23, 2023, and comments regarding the rule 
were received.  
 
Statement of Basis and Purpose 
 
The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP” or “Department”) is adding rules to implement 
new legislation regarding automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”). Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits 
employers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has 
been subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly 
available, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   
 
These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 15: 7 
 
(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor's justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 18: (a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the 
bias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was 
generated and obtained.  
 
Example 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time. The employer may rely on a bias 
audit conducted using the historical data of other employers or employment agencies, or on a bias audit 
conducted using test data.",[],"{'question_type': 'out of scope', 'seed_document_id': 17, 'topic': 'Definitions', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': 'The AEDT is a software developed by a team of engineers.'}",The given context information does not provide any specific names of people who have developed the AEDT software.,True,"The agent correctly states that the context does not provide specific names of the developers of the AEDT software, which aligns with the ground truth.",1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,"The generated answer accurately reflects the lack of specific names provided in the context, aligning perfectly with the reference answer."

(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for

using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency's data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer

 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies;

 
Clarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, 
race/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; 
 
Clarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they 
provide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and 
 
Clarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; 
 
The Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including 
from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations. Various 
issues raised in the comments resulted in changes that are present in these final rules. These changes include: 
 
Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies; 
 
Clarifying that the number of applicants in a category and scoring rate of a category, if applicable, must 
be included in the summary of results. 
 
New material is underlined. 
[Deleted material is in brackets.] 
 
“Shall” and “must” denote mandatory requirements and may be used interchangeably in the rules of this 
department, unless otherwise specified or unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;

Document 11: 5 
 
 
Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required

Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),

Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency's data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Note: The AEDT was used to assess 15 individuals with an unknown sex or race/ethnicity category. Data on 
these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'out of scope', 'seed_document_id': 11, 'topic': 'Enforcement and Penalties', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': 'The bias audit of the AEDT must be conducted by an external third-party company.'}",The text does not provide the name of the person responsible for conducting the bias audit of the AEDT.,True,"The agent correctly states that the name of the person responsible for conducting the bias audit of the AEDT is not provided, aligning with the ground truth.",1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,"The generated answer accurately reflects the lack of information in the context regarding the person responsible for the bias audit of the AEDT, aligning perfectly with the reference answer."

iii. 
at any point during the bias audit, has a direct financial interest or a material indirect 
financial interest in an employer or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to 
use the  AEDT or in a vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT. 
 
Impact Ratio. “Impact ratio” means either (1) the selection rate for a category divided by the selection 
rate of the most selected category or (2) the scoring rate for a category divided by the scoring rate for the 
highest scoring category.  
 
 
 
    _________selection rate for a category________  
Impact Ratio =        selection rate of the most selected category  
 
OR 
 
  
 
     ______scoring rate for a category__________  
Impact Ratio =        scoring rate of the highest scoring category 
 
 
Machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence. “Machine learning, 
statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” means a group of mathematical, computer-
based techniques:  
i. 
that generate a prediction, meaning an expected outcome for an observation, such as an 
assessment of a candidate's fit or likelihood of success, or that generate a classification, 
meaning an assignment of an observation to a group, such as categorizations based on 
skill sets or aptitude; and  
ii. 
for which a computer at least in part identifies the inputs, the relative importance placed 
on those inputs, and, if applicable, other parameters for the models in order to improve 
the accuracy of the prediction or classification. 
 
Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample's median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example.

(3) Calculate the impact ratio for each category;  
(4) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision 
separately calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (i.e., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates); and  
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
(d) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (b) and paragraphs (3) and 
(4) of subdivision (c), an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of 
the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a 
category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor's justification for the 
exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded 
category.  
 
Example: An employer uses an AEDT to score applicants for “culture fit.” To do so, the employer must 
ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than a year before the use of the AEDT.

Document 10: Scoring Rate. “Scoring Rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above 
the sample's median score, where the score has been calculated by an AEDT. 
 
Screen. “Screen” means to make a determination about whether a candidate for employment or 
employee being considered for promotion should be selected or advanced in the hiring or promotion 
process.  
 
Selection Rate. “Selection rate” means the rate at which individuals in a category are either selected to 
move forward in the hiring process or assigned a classification by an AEDT. Such rate may be calculated 
by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate's estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate's resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the 
output from analytical tools that translate or transcribe existing text, e.g., convert a resume from a PDF 
or transcribe a video or audio interview.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law.

Modifying the definition of “machine learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence” 
to expand its scope; 
 
Adding a requirement that the bias audit indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are 
not included in the calculations because they fall within an unknown category, and requiring that number 
be included in the summary of results; 
 
Allowing an independent auditor to exclude a category that comprises less than 2% of the data being 
used for the bias audit from the calculations of impact ratio; 
 
Clarifying the examples of a bias audit; 
 
Clarifying when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted using the 
historical data of other employers or employment agencies; 
 
Providing examples of when an employer or employment agency may rely on a bias audit conducted with 
historical data, test data, or historical data from other employers and employment agencies;

§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

these individuals was not included in the calculations above. 
§ 5-302 Data Requirements. 
(a) Historical Data. A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical 
data of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers 
or employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency 
may rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment 
agencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical 
data from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such 
employer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. 
(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or 
employment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available 
to conduct a statistically significant bias audit.",[],"{'question_type': 'out of scope', 'seed_document_id': 13, 'topic': 'Metrics/Data', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': 'The average age of the male applicants in the White category is 35.'}","The given context information does not provide any information about the age of the applicants.

by dividing the number of individuals in the category moving forward or assigned a classification by the 
total number of individuals in the category who applied for a position or were considered for promotion.  
 
Example. If 100 Hispanic women apply for a position and 40 are selected for an interview after use of an 
AEDT, the selection rate for Hispanic women is 40/100 or 40%.  
 
Simplified output. “Simplified output” means a prediction or classification as specified in the definition 
for “machine learning, statistical modelling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence.” A simplified output 
may take the form of a score (e.g., rating a candidate's estimated technical skills), tag or categorization 
(e.g., categorizing a candidate's resume based on key words, assigning a skill or trait to a candidate), 
recommendation (e.g., whether a candidate should be given an interview), or ranking (e.g., arranging a 
list of candidates based on how well their cover letters match the job description). It does not refer to the

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency's data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;",[],"{'question_type': 'out of scope', 'seed_document_id': 12, 'topic': 'Metrics/Data', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': 'The impact ratio for female applicants is 0.950.'}","There is no information provided in the context about the impact ratio for non-binary applicants. The only information provided is about the impact ratio for sex categories (i.e., male candidates vs female candidates) and race/ethnicity categories (e.g., Hispanic or Latino candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates). Additionally, the context mentions that an independent auditor may exclude a category that represents less than 2% of the data being used for the bias audit from the required calculations for impact ratio. Where such a category is excluded, the summary of results must include the independent auditor’s justification for the exclusion, as well as the number of applicants and scoring rate or selection rate for the excluded category.",True,,1.0,0.8888888888888888,0.0,0.0,5.0,The generated answer accurately states that there is no information available regarding the impact ratio for non-binary applicants and provides relevant context about the data limitations.

§ 20-870 Definitions.
For the purposes of this subchapter, the following terms have the following meanings:
   Automated employment decision tool. The term ""automated employment decision tool"" means any computational process, derived from machine
learning, statistical modeling, data analytics, or artificial intelligence, that issues simplified output, including a score, classification, or recommendation,
that is used to substantially assist or replace discretionary decision making for making employment decisions that impact natural persons. The term
""automated employment decision tool"" does not include a tool that does not automate, support, substantially assist or replace discretionary decision-
making processes and that does not materially impact natural persons, including, but not limited to, a junk email filter, firewall, antivirus software,
calculator, spreadsheet, database, data set, or other compilation of data.
   Bias audit. The term ""bias audit"" means an impartial evaluation by an independent auditor. Such bias audit shall include but not be limited to the
testing of an automated employment decision tool to assess the tool's disparate impact on persons of any component 1 category required to be reported
by employers pursuant to subsection (c) of section 2000e-8 of title 42 of the United States code as specified in part 1602.7 of title 29 of the code of
federal regulations.

However, it does mention that an independent auditor must conduct the bias audit, and that the auditor may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or distributed the AEDT. Therefore, it may be helpful to seek out an independent auditor who meets these criteria.",False,"The agent's answer implies that an independent auditor is the best person to conduct a bias audit, which is a specific recommendation.

using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit. The vendor provides historical data regarding 
applicant selection that the vendor has collected from multiple employers to an independent auditor who 
will conduct a bias audit as follows:

Test data. “Test data” means data used to conduct a bias audit that is not historical data. 
§ 5-301 Bias Audit. 
(a) An employer or employment agency may not use or continue to use an AEDT if more than one year has 
passed since the most recent bias audit of the AEDT.  
(b) Where an AEDT selects candidates for employment or employees being considered for promotion to 
move forward in the hiring process or classifies them into groups, a bias audit must, at a minimum: 
(1) Calculate the selection rate for each category; 
(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; 
(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately 
calculate the impact of the AEDT on: 
i. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  
ii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino 
candidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and 
iii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of 
Hispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American 
female candidates). 
(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for 
each group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered 
for promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and 
(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required 
calculations because they fall within an unknown category. 
 
Example: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job 
posting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than 
a year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not 
using the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application 
process. The employer asks the vendor for a bias audit.

Document 19: 9 
 
Example 2: An employment agency has been using an AEDT for 6 months. The bias audit the 
employment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test 
data. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 
months have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency's data 
from 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias 
audit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and 
employment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and 
consideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. 
 
Example 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. 
The employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may 
rely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of 
historical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a 
bias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other 
employers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test 
data.  
 
§ 5-303 Published Results. 
(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following 
publicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  
(1) 
The date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall 
include the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of 
individuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of 
applicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios 
for all categories; and, 
(2) 
The distribution date of the AEDT.

Document 5: These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and 
sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) 
pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to 
determine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform 
Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations 
of employers and employment agencies under the new law. 
 
Specifically, these new rules will: 
 
Define terms; 
 
Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  
 
Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees 
and candidates for employment; and  
 
Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  
 
The Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received 
comments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and 
advocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, 
published in December 2022. Those changes included:  
 
Modifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; 
 
Clarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer 
or employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or 
distributed the AEDT; 
 
Revising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;",[],"{'question_type': 'out of scope', 'seed_document_id': 12, 'topic': 'Requirements', 'distracting_context': None, 'situational_context': None, 'original_questions': None, 'fake_fact': 'The vendor provides historical data regarding applicant salary.'}","I'm sorry, I cannot find any information in the given context about the type of data that a vendor provides regarding applicant selection in Venezuela. The context only provides information about the definitions of various terms related to the use of automated employment decision tools (AEDT) in New York City, the requirements for bias audits of AEDTs, and the obligations of employers and employment agencies under the new law.",True,The agent correctly states that there is no information available in the context regarding the type of data provided by the vendor about applicant selection in Venezuela.,1.0,0.75,0.0,0.0,5.0,"The generated answer accurately reflects the lack of information in the context regarding the vendor's data on applicant selection in Venezuela, aligning perfectly with the reference answer."
