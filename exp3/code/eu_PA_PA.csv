In order to ensure a level playing field and an effective protection of rights and freedoms of 
individuals across the Union, the rules established by this Regulation should apply to 
providers of AI systems in a non-discriminatory manner, irrespective of whether they are 
established within the Union or in a third country, and to deployers of AI systems 
established within the Union.
(22)
In light of their digital nature, certain AI systems should fall within the scope of this 
Regulation even when they are not placed on the market, put into service, or used in the 
Union. This is the case, for example, where an operator established in the Union contracts 
certain services to an operator established in a third country in relation to an activity to be 
performed by an AI system that would qualify as high-risk ▌ . In those circumstances, the 
AI system used in a third country by the operator could process data lawfully collected in 
and transferred from the Union, and provide to the contracting operator in the Union the 
output of that AI system resulting from that processing, without that AI system being 
placed on the market, put into service or used in the Union. To prevent the circumvention 
of this Regulation and to ensure an effective protection of natural persons located in the 
Union, this Regulation should also apply to providers and deployers of AI systems that are 
established in a third country, to the extent the output produced by those systems is 
intended to be used in the Union.

▌ AI systems ▌ can be easily deployed in a large variety of sectors of the economy and 
many parts of society, including across borders, and can easily circulate throughout the 
Union. Certain Member States have already explored the adoption of national rules to 
ensure that AI is trustworthy and safe and is developed and used in accordance with 
fundamental rights obligations. Diverging national rules may lead to the fragmentation of 
the internal market and may decrease legal certainty for operators that develop, import or 
use AI systems. A consistent and high level of protection throughout the Union should 
therefore be ensured in order to achieve trustworthy AI, while divergences hampering the 
free circulation, innovation, deployment and the uptake of AI systems and related 
products and services within the internal market should be prevented by laying down 
uniform obligations for operators and guaranteeing the uniform protection of overriding 
reasons of public interest and of rights of persons throughout the internal market on the 
basis of Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). To 
the extent that this Regulation contains specific rules on the protection of individuals with 
regard to the processing of personal data concerning restrictions of the use of AI systems 
for remote biometric identification for the purpose of law enforcement, of the use of AI 
systems for risk assessments of natural persons for the purpose of law enforcement and

1. Protection of public safety and health: The rapid availability of innovative technologies may be crucial for the health and safety of persons, the protection of the environment and climate change, and for society as a whole. Therefore, the regulations aim to ensure that AI systems placed on the market or put into service in the EU comply with the necessary safety and health standards.

2. Protection of individual rights: The regulations aim to ensure that the design, development, and use of AI systems do not infringe on the rights and freedoms of individuals, including their right to privacy and protection of personal data. Data subjects continue to enjoy all the rights and guarantees awarded to them by Union law, including the rights related to solely automated individual decision-making, including profiling.

3. Maintaining market integrity: The regulations aim to create a level-playing field for operators and ensure that providers of AI systems comply with the necessary standards and obligations. This includes appointing an authorized representative established in the Union, registering themselves and information about their AI system in an EU database, and fulfilling all relevant obligations associated with their roles as importers and distributors.

(115)
Providers of general-purpose AI models with systemic risks should assess and mitigate 
possible systemic risks. If, despite efforts to identify and prevent risks related to a 
general-purpose AI model that may present systemic risks, the development or use of the 
model causes a serious incident, the general-purpose AI model provider should without 
undue delay keep track of the incident and report any relevant information and possible 
corrective measures to the Commission and national competent authorities. 
Furthermore, providers should ensure an adequate level of cybersecurity protection for 
the model and its physical infrastructure, if appropriate, along the entire model lifecycle. 
Cybersecurity protection related to systemic risks associated with malicious use or 
attacks should duly consider accidental model leakage, unauthorised releases, 
circumvention of safety measures, and defence against cyberattacks, unauthorised 
access or model theft. That protection could be facilitated by securing model weights, 
algorithms, servers, and data sets, such as through operational security measures for 
information security, specific cybersecurity policies, adequate technical and established 
solutions, and cyber and physical access controls, appropriate to the relevant 
circumstances and the risks involved.

(113)
If the Commission becomes aware of the fact that a general-purpose AI model meets the 
requirements to classify as a general-purpose AI model with systemic risk, which 
previously had either not been known or of which the relevant provider has failed to 
notify the Commission, the Commission should be empowered to designate it so. A 
system of qualified alerts should ensure that the AI Office is made aware by the 
scientific panel of general-purpose AI models that should possibly be classified as 
general-purpose AI models with systemic risk, in addition to the monitoring activities of 
the AI Office.
(114)
The providers of general-purpose AI models presenting systemic risks should be subject, 
in addition to the obligations provided for providers of general-purpose AI models, to 
obligations aimed at identifying and mitigating those risks and ensuring an adequate 
level of cybersecurity protection, regardless of whether it is provided as a standalone 
model or embedded in an AI system or a product. To achieve those objectives, this 
Regulation should require providers to perform the necessary model evaluations, in 
particular prior to its first placing on the market, including conducting and documenting 
adversarial testing of models, also, as appropriate, through internal or independent 
external testing. In addition, providers of general-purpose AI models with systemic risks 
should continuously assess and mitigate systemic risks, including for example by putting 
in place risk-management policies, such as accountability and governance processes, 
implementing post-market monitoring, taking appropriate measures along the entire 
model’s lifecycle and cooperating with relevant actors along the AI value chain.",[],"{'question_type': 'complex', 'seed_document_id': 115, 'topic': 'Systemic Risks in AI'}","According to the EU AI Act, providers of general-purpose AI models with systemic risks should take the following actions immediately after a serious incident occurs, despite their previous risk mitigation strategies:

Moreover, the list of criminal offences provided in an annex to this Regulation is based 
on the 32 criminal offences listed in the Council Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA18, 
taking into account that some of those offences are, in practice, likely to be more relevant 
than others, in that the recourse to ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification could, 
foreseeably, be necessary and proportionate to highly varying degrees for the practical 
pursuit of the localisation or identification of a perpetrator or suspect of the different 
criminal offences listed and having regard to the likely differences in the seriousness, 
probability and scale of the harm or possible negative consequences. An imminent threat 
to life or the physical safety of natural persons could also result from a serious 
disruption of critical infrastructure, as defined in Article 2, point (4) of Directive (EU) 
2022/2557 of the European Parliament and of the Council19, where the disruption or 
destruction of such critical infrastructure would result in an imminent threat to life or 
the physical safety of a person, including through serious harm to the provision of basic

this Regulation should preserve the ability for law enforcement, border control, 
immigration or asylum authorities to carry out identity checks in the presence of the

national law, to identify persons who, during an identity check, either refuse to be 
identified or are unable to state or prove their identity, without being required by this 
Regulation to obtain prior authorisation. This could be, for example, a person involved 
in a crime, being unwilling, or unable due to an accident or a medical condition, to 
disclose their identity to law enforcement authorities.

Firstly, it is important to note that the use of AI systems for 'real-time' remote biometric identification of natural persons in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement is particularly intrusive to the rights and freedoms of the concerned persons. Therefore, the use of such systems for the purpose of law enforcement should be prohibited, except in exhaustively listed and narrowly defined situations, where the use is strictly necessary to achieve a substantial public interest, the importance of which outweighs the risks.

The use of the 'real-time' remote biometric identification system in publicly accessible spaces shall be authorised only if the law enforcement authority has completed a fundamental rights impact assessment as provided for in Article 27 and has registered the system in the EU database according to Article 49.

Finally, any processing of biometric data involved in the use of AI systems for biometric identification for the purpose of law enforcement needs to comply with Article 10 of Directive (EU) 2016/680, that allows such processing only where strictly necessary, subject to appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of the data subject, and where authorised by Union or Member State law. Such use, when authorised, also needs to respect the principles laid down in Article 4 (1) of Directive (EU) 2016/680 including lawfulness, fairness and transparency, purpose limitation, accuracy and storage limitation.

To ensure legal certainty, it is necessary to clarify that, under certain specific conditions, 
any distributor, importer, deployer or other third-party should be considered to be a 
provider of a high-risk AI system and therefore assume all the relevant obligations. This 
would be the case if that party puts its name or trademark on a high-risk AI system 
already placed on the market or put into service, without prejudice to contractual 
arrangements stipulating that the obligations are allocated otherwise. This would also be 
the case if that party makes a substantial modification to a high-risk AI system that has 
already been placed on the market or has already been put into service in a way that it 
remains a high-risk AI system in accordance with this Regulation, or if it modifies the 
intended purpose of an AI system, including a general-purpose AI system, which has not 
been classified as high-risk and has already been placed on the market or put into 
service, in a way that the AI system becomes a high-risk AI system in accordance with 
this Regulation. Those provisions should apply without prejudice to more specific 
provisions established in certain Union harmonisation legislation based on the New 
Legislative Framework, together with which this Regulation should apply. For example, 
Article 16(2) of Regulation (EU) 2017/745, establishing that certain changes should not

Irrespective of whether an AI system is placed on the market or put into service 
independently of the products referred to in points (a) and (b), that AI system shall be 
considered to be high-risk where both of the following conditions are fulfilled:
(a)
the AI system is intended to be used as a safety component of a product, or the AI 
system is itself a product, covered by the Union harmonisation legislation listed in 
Annex I;
(b)
the product whose safety component pursuant to point (a) is the AI system, or the 
AI system itself as a product, is required to undergo a third-party conformity 
assessment, with a view to the placing on the market or the putting into service of 
that product pursuant to the Union harmonisation legislation listed in Annex I.

High-risk AI systems should only be placed on the Union market, put into service or used 
if they comply with certain mandatory requirements. Those requirements should ensure 
that high-risk AI systems available in the Union or whose output is otherwise used in the 
Union do not pose unacceptable risks to important Union public interests as recognised and 
protected by Union law. On the basis of the New Legislative Framework, as clarified in 
the Commission notice “The ‘Blue Guide’ on the implementation of EU product rules 
2022”20, the general rule is that more than one legal act of Union harmonisation 
legislation, such as Regulations (EU) 2017/74521 and (EU) 2017/74622 of the European 
Parliament and of the Council or Directive 2006/42/EC of the European Parliament and 
of the Council23, may be applicable to one product, since the making available or putting 
into service can take place only when the product complies with all applicable Union 
harmonisation legislation. To ensure consistency and avoid unnecessary administrative 
burdens or costs, providers of a product that contains one or more high-risk AI systems, 
to which the requirements of this Regulation and of the Union harmonisation legislation 
listed in an annex to this Regulation apply, should have flexibility with regard to 
operational decisions on how to ensure compliance of a product that contains one or 
more AI systems with all applicable requirements of the Union harmonisation legislation 
in an optimal manner. AI systems identified as high-risk should be limited to those that 
have a significant harmful impact on the health, safety and fundamental rights of persons 
in the Union and such limitation should minimise any potential restriction to international 
trade.

In light of their digital nature, certain AI systems should fall within the scope of this 
Regulation even when they are not placed on the market, put into service, or used in the 
Union. This is the case, for example, where an operator established in the Union contracts 
certain services to an operator established in a third country in relation to an activity to be 
performed by an AI system that would qualify as high-risk ▌ . In those circumstances, the 
AI system used in a third country by the operator could process data lawfully collected in 
and transferred from the Union, and provide to the contracting operator in the Union the 
output of that AI system resulting from that processing, without that AI system being 
placed on the market, put into service or used in the Union. To prevent the circumvention 
of this Regulation and to ensure an effective protection of natural persons located in the 
Union, this Regulation should also apply to providers and deployers of AI systems that are 
established in a third country, to the extent the output produced by those systems is 
intended to be used in the Union.

▌ AI systems ▌ can be easily deployed in a large variety of sectors of the economy and 
many parts of society, including across borders, and can easily circulate throughout the 
Union. Certain Member States have already explored the adoption of national rules to 
ensure that AI is trustworthy and safe and is developed and used in accordance with 
fundamental rights obligations. Diverging national rules may lead to the fragmentation of 
the internal market and may decrease legal certainty for operators that develop, import or 
use AI systems. A consistent and high level of protection throughout the Union should 
therefore be ensured in order to achieve trustworthy AI, while divergences hampering the 
free circulation, innovation, deployment and the uptake of AI systems and related 
products and services within the internal market should be prevented by laying down 
uniform obligations for operators and guaranteeing the uniform protection of overriding 
reasons of public interest and of rights of persons throughout the internal market on the 
basis of Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). To 
the extent that this Regulation contains specific rules on the protection of individuals with

"What actions should a provider take if their general-purpose AI model is classified as having systemic risks, and how does the Commission determine this designation?","If a provider's general-purpose AI model meets the criteria for systemic risks, they must notify the AI Office within two weeks.

(112)
It is also necessary to clarify a procedure for the classification of a general-purpose AI 
model with systemic risks. A general-purpose AI model that meets the applicable 
threshold for high-impact capabilities should be presumed to be a general-purpose AI 
models with systemic risk. The provider should notify the AI Office at the latest two 
weeks after the requirements are met or it becomes known that a general-purpose AI 
model will meet the requirements that lead to the presumption. This is especially relevant 
in relation to the threshold of floating point operations because training of general-
purpose AI models takes considerable planning which includes the upfront allocation of 
compute resources and, therefore, providers of general-purpose AI models are able to 
know if their model would meet the threshold before the training is completed. In the 
context of that notification, the provider should be able to demonstrate that, because of 
its specific characteristics, a general-purpose AI model exceptionally does not present 
systemic risks, and that it thus should not be classified as a general-purpose AI model 
with systemic risks. That information is valuable for the AI Office to anticipate the 
placing on the market of general-purpose AI models with systemic risks and the 
providers can start to engage with the AI Office early on. That information is especially 
important with regard to general-purpose AI models that are planned to be released as 
open-source, given that, after the open-source model release, necessary measures to 
ensure compliance with the obligations under this Regulation may be more difficult to 
implement.

Document 111: EN

(111)
It is appropriate to establish a methodology for the classification of general-purpose AI 
models as general-purpose AI model with systemic risks. Since systemic risks result from 
particularly high capabilities, a general-purpose AI model should be considered to 
present systemic risks if it has high-impact capabilities, evaluated on the basis of 
appropriate technical tools and methodologies, or significant impact on the internal 
market due to its reach. High-impact capabilities in general-purpose AI models means 
capabilities that match or exceed the capabilities recorded in the most advanced general-
purpose AI models. The full range of capabilities in a model could be better understood 
after its placing on the market or when deployers interact with the model. According to 
the state of the art at the time of entry into force of this Regulation, the cumulative 
amount of computation used for the training of the general-purpose AI model measured 
in floating point operations is one of the relevant approximations for model capabilities. 
The cumulative amount of computation used for training includes the computation used 
across the activities and methods that are intended to enhance the capabilities of the 
model prior to deployment, such as pre-training, synthetic data generation and fine-
tuning. Therefore, an initial threshold of floating point operations should be set, which, 
if met by a general-purpose AI model, leads to a presumption that the model is a 
general-purpose AI model with systemic risks. This threshold should be adjusted over 
time to reflect technological and industrial changes, such as algorithmic improvements 
or increased hardware efficiency, and should be supplemented with benchmarks and 
indicators for model capability.

Document 112: EN
United in diversity
EN
To inform this, the AI Office should engage with the scientific community, industry, civil 
society and other experts. Thresholds, as well as tools and benchmarks for the 
assessment of high-impact capabilities, should be strong predictors of generality, its 
capabilities and associated systemic risk of general-purpose AI models, and could take 
into account the way the model will be placed on the market or the number of users it 
may affect. To complement this system, there should be a possibility for the Commission 
to take individual decisions designating a general-purpose AI model as a general-
purpose AI model with systemic risk if it is found that such model has capabilities or an 
impact equivalent to those captured by the set threshold. That decision should be taken 
on the basis of an overall assessment of the criteria for the designation of a general-
purpose AI model with systemic risk set out in an annex to this Regulation, such as 
quality or size of the training data set, number of business and end users, its input and 
output modalities, its level of autonomy and scalability, or the tools it has access to. 
Upon a reasoned request of a provider whose model has been designated as a general-
purpose AI model with systemic risk, the Commission should take the request into 
account and may decide to reassess whether the general-purpose AI model can still be 
considered to present systemic risks.

"What are the potential adverse impacts of poorly designed high-risk AI systems used by law enforcement authorities, and how do these systems contribute to these risks?","Poorly designed high-risk AI systems, such as those used for assessing crime victim risk or evaluating evidence reliability, can result in unjust surveillance and discrimination, leading to wrongful arrests or loss of liberty. The inherent risks of these systems are amplified when they are not designed with fairness and accountability in mind, potentially exacerbating issues of bias and injustice in law enforcement.","Document 67: EN

Given their role and responsibility, actions by law enforcement authorities involving 
certain uses of AI systems are characterised by a significant degree of power imbalance 
and may lead to surveillance, arrest or deprivation of a natural person’s liberty as well as 
other adverse impacts on fundamental rights guaranteed in the Charter. In particular, if the 
AI system is not trained with high-quality data, does not meet adequate requirements in 
terms of its performance, its accuracy or robustness, or is not properly designed and tested 
before being put on the market or otherwise put into service, it may single out people in a 
discriminatory or otherwise incorrect or unjust manner. Furthermore, the exercise of 
important procedural fundamental rights, such as the right to an effective remedy and to a 
fair trial as well as the right of defence and the presumption of innocence, could be 
hampered, in particular, where such AI systems are not sufficiently transparent, 
explainable and documented. It is therefore appropriate to classify as high-risk, insofar as 
their use is permitted under relevant Union and national law, a number of AI systems

HIGH-RISK AI SYSTEMS

Classification rules for high-risk AI systems
1.
Irrespective of whether an AI system is placed on the market or put into service 
independently of the products referred to in points (a) and (b), that AI system shall be 
considered to be high-risk where both of the following conditions are fulfilled:
(a)
the AI system is intended to be used as a safety component of a product, or the AI 
system is itself a product, covered by the Union harmonisation legislation listed in 
Annex I;
(b)
the product whose safety component pursuant to point (a) is the AI system, or the 
AI system itself as a product, is required to undergo a third-party conformity 
assessment, with a view to the placing on the market or the putting into service of 
that product pursuant to the Union harmonisation legislation listed in Annex I.

High-risk AI systems should only be placed on the Union market, put into service or used 
if they comply with certain mandatory requirements. Those requirements should ensure 
that high-risk AI systems available in the Union or whose output is otherwise used in the 
Union do not pose unacceptable risks to important Union public interests as recognised and 
protected by Union law. On the basis of the New Legislative Framework, as clarified in 
the Commission notice “The ‘Blue Guide’ on the implementation of EU product rules 
2022”20, the general rule is that more than one legal act of Union harmonisation 
legislation, such as Regulations (EU) 2017/74521 and (EU) 2017/74622 of the European 
Parliament and of the Council or Directive 2006/42/EC of the European Parliament and 
of the Council23, may be applicable to one product, since the making available or putting 
into service can take place only when the product complies with all applicable Union 
harmonisation legislation. To ensure consistency and avoid unnecessary administrative 
burdens or costs, providers of a product that contains one or more high-risk AI systems, 
to which the requirements of this Regulation and of the Union harmonisation legislation 
listed in an annex to this Regulation apply, should have flexibility with regard to 
operational decisions on how to ensure compliance of a product that contains one or 
more AI systems with all applicable requirements of the Union harmonisation legislation 
in an optimal manner. AI systems identified as high-risk should be limited to those that 
have a significant harmful impact on the health, safety and fundamental rights of persons 
in the Union and such limitation should minimise any potential restriction to international 
trade.

excluding the need for compliance for persons who develop or use models for non-
professional or scientific research purposes, who should nevertheless be encouraged to 
voluntarily comply with these requirements. Without prejudice to Union copyright law, 
compliance with those obligations should take due account of the size of the provider 
and allow simplified ways of compliance for SMEs, including start-ups, that should not 
represent an excessive cost and not discourage the use of such models. In the case of a 
modification or fine-tuning of a model, the obligations for providers of general-purpose 
AI models should be limited to that modification or fine-tuning, for example by

This calls for a simultaneous and complementary application of the various legislative 
acts. To ensure consistency and to avoid an unnecessary administrative burden and 
unnecessary costs, providers of a product that contains one or more high-risk AI system, 
to which the requirements of this Regulation and of the Union harmonisation legislation 
based on the New Legislative Framework and listed in an annex to this Regulation 
apply, should have flexibility with regard to operational decisions on how to ensure 
compliance of a product that contains one or more AI systems with all the applicable 
requirements of that Union harmonised legislation in an optimal manner. That 
flexibility could mean, for example a decision by the provider to integrate a part of the 
necessary testing and reporting processes, information and documentation required 
under this Regulation into already existing documentation and procedures required 
under existing Union harmonisation legislation based on the New Legislative 
Framework and listed in an annex to this Regulation. This should not, in any way,

High-risk AI systems should only be placed on the Union market, put into service or used 
if they comply with certain mandatory requirements. Those requirements should ensure 
that high-risk AI systems available in the Union or whose output is otherwise used in the 
Union do not pose unacceptable risks to important Union public interests as recognised and 
protected by Union law. On the basis of the New Legislative Framework, as clarified in 
the Commission notice “The ‘Blue Guide’ on the implementation of EU product rules 
2022”20, the general rule is that more than one legal act of Union harmonisation 
legislation, such as Regulations (EU) 2017/74521 and (EU) 2017/74622 of the European 
Parliament and of the Council or Directive 2006/42/EC of the European Parliament and 
of the Council23, may be applicable to one product, since the making available or putting 
into service can take place only when the product complies with all applicable Union 
harmonisation legislation. To ensure consistency and avoid unnecessary administrative 
burdens or costs, providers of a product that contains one or more high-risk AI systems, 
to which the requirements of this Regulation and of the Union harmonisation legislation 
listed in an annex to this Regulation apply, should have flexibility with regard to 
operational decisions on how to ensure compliance of a product that contains one or 
more AI systems with all applicable requirements of the Union harmonisation legislation 
in an optimal manner. AI systems identified as high-risk should be limited to those that 
have a significant harmful impact on the health, safety and fundamental rights of persons 
in the Union and such limitation should minimise any potential restriction to international 
trade.

To mitigate the risks from high-risk AI systems placed on the market or put into service 
and to ensure a high level of trustworthiness, certain mandatory requirements should 
apply to high-risk AI systems, taking into account the intended purpose and the context of 
use of the AI system and according to the risk-management system to be established by the 
provider. The measures adopted by the providers to comply with the mandatory 
requirements of this Regulation should take into account the generally acknowledged 
state of the art on AI, be proportionate and effective to meet the objectives of this 
Regulation. Based on the New Legislative Framework, as clarified in Commission notice 
“The ‘Blue Guide’ on the implementation of EU product rules 2022”, the general rule is 
that more than one legal act of Union harmonisation legislation may be applicable to 
one product, since the making available or putting into service can take place only when 
the product complies with all applicable Union harmonisation legislation. The hazards 
of AI systems covered by the requirements of this Regulation concern different aspects 
than the existing Union harmonisation legislation and therefore the requirements of this 
Regulation would complement the existing body of the Union harmonisation legislation.

system.
2.
The post-market monitoring system shall actively and systematically collect, document and

through other sources on the performance of high-risk AI systems throughout their 
lifetime, and which allow the provider to evaluate the continuous compliance of AI 
systems with the requirements set out in Chapter III, Section 2. Where relevant, post-
market monitoring shall include an analysis of the interaction with other AI systems. 
This obligation shall not cover sensitive operational data of deployers which are law-
enforcement authorities.

In order to ensure that providers of high-risk AI systems can take into account the 
experience on the use of high-risk AI systems for improving their systems and the design 
and development process or can take any possible corrective action in a timely manner, all 
providers should have a post-market monitoring system in place. Where relevant, post-
market monitoring should include an analysis of the interaction with other AI systems 
including other devices and software. Post-market monitoring should not cover sensitive 
operational data of deployers which are law enforcement authorities. This system is also 
key to ensure that the possible risks emerging from AI systems which continue to ‘learn’ 
after being placed on the market or put into service can be more efficiently and timely 
addressed. In this context, providers should also be required to have a system in place to 
report to the relevant authorities any serious incidents resulting from the use of their AI 
systems, meaning incident or malfunctioning leading to death or serious damage to 
health, serious and irreversible disruption of the management and operation of critical 
infrastructure, infringements of obligations under Union law intended to protect

What is the purpose of establishing uniform obligations for operators of AI systems within the EU?,"The purpose is to ensure a consistent and high level of protection throughout the Union, achieve trustworthy AI, and prevent divergences that may hamper the free circulation, innovation, deployment, and uptake of AI systems and related products and services within the internal market.","Document 3: EN

▌ AI systems ▌ can be easily deployed in a large variety of sectors of the economy and 
many parts of society, including across borders, and can easily circulate throughout the 
Union. Certain Member States have already explored the adoption of national rules to 
ensure that AI is trustworthy and safe and is developed and used in accordance with 
fundamental rights obligations. Diverging national rules may lead to the fragmentation of 
the internal market and may decrease legal certainty for operators that develop, import or 
use AI systems. A consistent and high level of protection throughout the Union should 
therefore be ensured in order to achieve trustworthy AI, while divergences hampering the 
free circulation, innovation, deployment and the uptake of AI systems and related 
products and services within the internal market should be prevented by laying down 
uniform obligations for operators and guaranteeing the uniform protection of overriding 
reasons of public interest and of rights of persons throughout the internal market on the 
basis of Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). To 
the extent that this Regulation contains specific rules on the protection of individuals with 
regard to the processing of personal data concerning restrictions of the use of AI systems 
for remote biometric identification for the purpose of law enforcement, of the use of AI 
systems for risk assessments of natural persons for the purpose of law enforcement and 
of the use of AI systems of biometric categorisation for the purpose of law enforcement, it 
is appropriate to base this Regulation, in so far as those specific rules are concerned, on 
Article 16 TFEU. In light of those specific rules and the recourse to Article 16 TFEU, it is 
appropriate to consult the European Data Protection Board.

In order to ensure a level playing field and an effective protection of rights and freedoms of 
individuals across the Union, the rules established by this Regulation should apply to 
providers of AI systems in a non-discriminatory manner, irrespective of whether they are 
established within the Union or in a third country, and to deployers of AI systems 
established within the Union.
(22)
In light of their digital nature, certain AI systems should fall within the scope of this 
Regulation even when they are not placed on the market, put into service, or used in the 
Union. This is the case, for example, where an operator established in the Union contracts 
certain services to an operator established in a third country in relation to an activity to be 
performed by an AI system that would qualify as high-risk ▌ . In those circumstances, the 
AI system used in a third country by the operator could process data lawfully collected in 
and transferred from the Union, and provide to the contracting operator in the Union the 
output of that AI system resulting from that processing, without that AI system being 
placed on the market, put into service or used in the Union. To prevent the circumvention 
of this Regulation and to ensure an effective protection of natural persons located in the 
Union, this Regulation should also apply to providers and deployers of AI systems that are 
established in a third country, to the extent the output produced by those systems is 
intended to be used in the Union.",[],"{'question_type': 'simple', 'seed_document_id': 3, 'topic': 'AI Regulation in the EU'}","The purpose of establishing uniform obligations for operators of AI systems within the EU is to ensure a consistent and high level of protection throughout the Union in order to achieve trustworthy AI, while preventing divergences that may hamper the free circulation, innovation, deployment, and uptake of AI systems and related products and services within the internal market.

What should a provider do if their general-purpose AI model meets the threshold for high-impact capabilities?,The provider should notify the AI Office at the latest two weeks after the requirements are met or it becomes known that a general-purpose AI model will meet the requirements that lead to the presumption.,"Document 111: EN
United in diversity
EN
(111)
It is appropriate to establish a methodology for the classification of general-purpose AI 
models as general-purpose AI model with systemic risks. Since systemic risks result from 
particularly high capabilities, a general-purpose AI model should be considered to 
present systemic risks if it has high-impact capabilities, evaluated on the basis of 
appropriate technical tools and methodologies, or significant impact on the internal 
market due to its reach. High-impact capabilities in general-purpose AI models means 
capabilities that match or exceed the capabilities recorded in the most advanced general-
purpose AI models. The full range of capabilities in a model could be better understood 
after its placing on the market or when deployers interact with the model. According to 
the state of the art at the time of entry into force of this Regulation, the cumulative 
amount of computation used for the training of the general-purpose AI model measured 
in floating point operations is one of the relevant approximations for model capabilities. 
The cumulative amount of computation used for training includes the computation used 
across the activities and methods that are intended to enhance the capabilities of the 
model prior to deployment, such as pre-training, synthetic data generation and fine-
tuning. Therefore, an initial threshold of floating point operations should be set, which, 
if met by a general-purpose AI model, leads to a presumption that the model is a 
general-purpose AI model with systemic risks. This threshold should be adjusted over 
time to reflect technological and industrial changes, such as algorithmic improvements 
or increased hardware efficiency, and should be supplemented with benchmarks and 
indicators for model capability.

Document 113: EN
United in diversity
EN
(112)
It is also necessary to clarify a procedure for the classification of a general-purpose AI 
model with systemic risks. A general-purpose AI model that meets the applicable 
threshold for high-impact capabilities should be presumed to be a general-purpose AI 
models with systemic risk. The provider should notify the AI Office at the latest two 
weeks after the requirements are met or it becomes known that a general-purpose AI 
model will meet the requirements that lead to the presumption. This is especially relevant 
in relation to the threshold of floating point operations because training of general-
purpose AI models takes considerable planning which includes the upfront allocation of 
compute resources and, therefore, providers of general-purpose AI models are able to 
know if their model would meet the threshold before the training is completed. In the 
context of that notification, the provider should be able to demonstrate that, because of 
its specific characteristics, a general-purpose AI model exceptionally does not present 
systemic risks, and that it thus should not be classified as a general-purpose AI model 
with systemic risks. That information is valuable for the AI Office to anticipate the 
placing on the market of general-purpose AI models with systemic risks and the 
providers can start to engage with the AI Office early on. That information is especially 
important with regard to general-purpose AI models that are planned to be released as 
open-source, given that, after the open-source model release, necessary measures to 
ensure compliance with the obligations under this Regulation may be more difficult to 
implement.

Document 112: EN
United in diversity
EN
To inform this, the AI Office should engage with the scientific community, industry, civil 
society and other experts. Thresholds, as well as tools and benchmarks for the 
assessment of high-impact capabilities, should be strong predictors of generality, its 
capabilities and associated systemic risk of general-purpose AI models, and could take 
into account the way the model will be placed on the market or the number of users it 
may affect. To complement this system, there should be a possibility for the Commission 
to take individual decisions designating a general-purpose AI model as a general-
purpose AI model with systemic risk if it is found that such model has capabilities or an 
impact equivalent to those captured by the set threshold. That decision should be taken 
on the basis of an overall assessment of the criteria for the designation of a general-
purpose AI model with systemic risk set out in an annex to this Regulation, such as 
quality or size of the training data set, number of business and end users, its input and 
output modalities, its level of autonomy and scalability, or the tools it has access to. 
Upon a reasoned request of a provider whose model has been designated as a general-
purpose AI model with systemic risk, the Commission should take the request into 
account and may decide to reassess whether the general-purpose AI model can still be 
considered to present systemic risks.",[],"{'question_type': 'simple', 'seed_document_id': 111, 'topic': 'Systemic Risks in AI'}","If a provider's general-purpose AI model meets the threshold for high-impact capabilities, they should notify the AI Office within two weeks after the requirements are met or it becomes known that the model will meet the requirements that lead to the presumption.

The provider of a general-purpose AI model that meets the condition referred to in 
Article 51(1), point (a), may present, with its notification, sufficiently substantiated 
arguments to demonstrate that, exceptionally, although it meets that requirement, the 
general-purpose AI model does not present, due to its specific characteristics, systemic

ANNEX XIII
Criteria for the designation of general-purpose AI models 
with systemic risk referred to in Article 51
For the purpose of determining that a general-purpose AI model has capabilities or an 
impact equivalent to those set out in Article 51(1), point (a), the Commission shall take into 
account the following criteria:
(a)
the number of parameters of the model;
(b)
the quality or size of the data set, for example measured through tokens;
(c)
the amount of computation used for training the model, measured in floating point 
operations or indicated by a combination of other variables such as estimated cost 
of training, estimated time required for the training, or estimated energy 
consumption for the training;
(d)
the input and output modalities of the model, such as text to text (large language 
models), text to image, multi-modality, and the state of the art thresholds for 
determining high-impact capabilities for each modality, and the specific type of 
inputs and outputs (e.g. biological sequences);
(e)
the benchmarks and evaluations of capabilities of the model, including 
considering the number of tasks without additional training, adaptability to learn 
new, distinct tasks, its level of autonomy and scalability, the tools it has access to;
(f)
whether it has a high impact on the internal market due to its reach, which shall 
be presumed when it has been made available to at least 10 000 registered business 
users established in the Union;
(g)
the number of registered end-users.

Document 113: EN
United in diversity
EN
(112)
It is also necessary to clarify a procedure for the classification of a general-purpose AI 
model with systemic risks. A general-purpose AI model that meets the applicable 
threshold for high-impact capabilities should be presumed to be a general-purpose AI 
models with systemic risk. The provider should notify the AI Office at the latest two 
weeks after the requirements are met or it becomes known that a general-purpose AI 
model will meet the requirements that lead to the presumption. This is especially relevant 
in relation to the threshold of floating point operations because training of general-
purpose AI models takes considerable planning which includes the upfront allocation of 
compute resources and, therefore, providers of general-purpose AI models are able to 
know if their model would meet the threshold before the training is completed. In the 
context of that notification, the provider should be able to demonstrate that, because of 
its specific characteristics, a general-purpose AI model exceptionally does not present 
systemic risks, and that it thus should not be classified as a general-purpose AI model 
with systemic risks. That information is valuable for the AI Office to anticipate the 
placing on the market of general-purpose AI models with systemic risks and the 
providers can start to engage with the AI Office early on. That information is especially 
important with regard to general-purpose AI models that are planned to be released as 
open-source, given that, after the open-source model release, necessary measures to 
ensure compliance with the obligations under this Regulation may be more difficult to 
implement.",[],"{'question_type': 'rule_conclusion', 'seed_document_id': 299, 'topic': 'Systemic Risks in AI'}","According to the EU AI Act, if a tech company develops a general-purpose AI model that meets the floating point operations threshold but argues that its unique design prevents systemic risks, the company should notify the AI Office within two weeks after the requirements are met or it becomes known that a general-purpose AI model will meet the requirements that lead to the presumption. The provider should be able to demonstrate that, because of its specific characteristics, a general-purpose AI model exceptionally does not present systemic risks, and that it thus should not be classified as a general-purpose AI model with systemic risks.

obtained prior to the use of the AI system with a view to identifying a person or persons. 
Exceptions to that rule should be allowed in duly justified situations on grounds of 
urgency, namely in situations where the need to use the systems concerned is such as to 
make it effectively and objectively impossible to obtain an authorisation before 
commencing the use of the AI system. In such situations of urgency, the use of the AI 
system should be restricted to the absolute minimum necessary and should be subject to 
appropriate safeguards and conditions, as determined in national law and specified in the 
context of each individual urgent use case by the law enforcement authority itself. In 
addition, the law enforcement authority should in such situations request such 
authorisation ▌ while providing the reasons for not having been able to request it earlier, 
without undue delay and at the latest within 24 hours. If such an authorisation is 
rejected, the use of real-time biometric identification systems linked to that authorisation 
should cease with immediate effect and all the data related to such use should be 
discarded and deleted. Such data includes input data directly acquired by an AI system 
in the course of the use of such system as well as the results and outputs of the use 
linked to that authorisation. It should not include input that is legally acquired in 
accordance with another Union or national law. In any case, no decision producing an

The use of AI systems for real-time remote biometric identification of natural persons in 
publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement necessarily involves the 
processing of biometric data. The rules of this Regulation that prohibit, subject to certain 
exceptions, such use, which are based on Article 16 TFEU, should apply as lex specialis in 
respect of the rules on the processing of biometric data contained in Article 10 of Directive 
(EU) 2016/680, thus regulating such use and the processing of biometric data involved in 
an exhaustive manner. Therefore, such use and processing should be possible only in as far 
as it is compatible with the framework set by this Regulation, without there being scope, 
outside that framework, for the competent authorities, where they act for purpose of law 
enforcement, to use such systems and process such data in connection thereto on the 
grounds listed in Article 10 of Directive (EU) 2016/680. In that context, this Regulation is 
not intended to provide the legal basis for the processing of personal data under Article 8 
of Directive (EU) 2016/680. However, the use of real-time remote biometric identification 
systems in publicly accessible spaces for purposes other than law enforcement, including 
by competent authorities, should not be covered by the specific framework regarding such 
use for the purpose of law enforcement set by this Regulation. Such use for purposes other 
than law enforcement should therefore not be subject to the requirement of an authorisation 
under this Regulation and the applicable detailed rules of national law that may give effect 
to that authorisation.

The use of AI systems for ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification of natural persons in 
publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement is particularly intrusive to 
the rights and freedoms of the concerned persons, to the extent that it may affect the 
private life of a large part of the population, evoke a feeling of constant surveillance and 
indirectly dissuade the exercise of the freedom of assembly and other fundamental rights. 
Technical inaccuracies of AI systems intended for the remote biometric identification of 
natural persons can lead to biased results and entail discriminatory effects. Such 
possible biased results and discriminatory effects are particularly relevant with regard to 
age, ethnicity, race, sex or disabilities. In addition, the immediacy of the impact and the 
limited opportunities for further checks or corrections in relation to the use of such systems 
operating in real-time carry heightened risks for the rights and freedoms of the persons 
concerned in the context of, or impacted by, law enforcement activities.

The use of those systems for the purpose of law enforcement should therefore be 
prohibited, except in exhaustively listed and narrowly defined situations, where the use is 
strictly necessary to achieve a substantial public interest, the importance of which 
outweighs the risks. Those situations involve the search for certain victims of crime ▌ 
including missing persons; certain threats to the life or to the physical safety of natural 
persons or of a terrorist attack; and the localisation or identification of perpetrators or 
suspects of the criminal offences listed in an annex to this Regulation, where those 
criminal offences are punishable in the Member State concerned by a custodial sentence or 
a detention order for a maximum period of at least four years and as they are defined in the 
law of that Member State. Such a threshold for the custodial sentence or detention order in

This Regulation regulates AI systems and AI models by imposing certain requirements 
and obligations for relevant market actors that are placing them on the market, putting 
into service or use in the Union, thereby complementing obligations for providers of 
intermediary services that embed such systems or models into their services regulated by 
Regulation (EU) 2022/2065. To the extent that such systems or models are embedded 
into designated very large online platforms or very large online search engines, they are 
subject to the risk-management framework provided for in Regulation (EU) 2022/2065. 
Consequently, the corresponding obligations of this Regulation should be presumed to 
be fulfilled, unless significant systemic risks not covered by Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 
emerge and are identified in such models. Within this framework, providers of very large 
online platforms and very large online search engines are obliged to assess potential 
systemic risks stemming from the design, functioning and use of their services, including 
how the design of algorithmic systems used in the service may contribute to such risks, 
as well as systemic risks stemming from potential misuses. Those providers are also 
obliged to take appropriate mitigating measures in observance of fundamental rights.

"What specific actions should a provider undertake if their general-purpose AI model meets the threshold for high-impact capabilities, particularly in relation to the information required under Article 49(3) for high-risk AI systems?",The provider should notify the AI Office at the latest two weeks after the requirements are met or it becomes known that a general-purpose AI model will meet the requirements that lead to the presumption.,"Document 111: EN
United in diversity
EN
(111)
It is appropriate to establish a methodology for the classification of general-purpose AI 
models as general-purpose AI model with systemic risks. Since systemic risks result from 
particularly high capabilities, a general-purpose AI model should be considered to 
present systemic risks if it has high-impact capabilities, evaluated on the basis of 
appropriate technical tools and methodologies, or significant impact on the internal 
market due to its reach. High-impact capabilities in general-purpose AI models means 
capabilities that match or exceed the capabilities recorded in the most advanced general-
purpose AI models. The full range of capabilities in a model could be better understood 
after its placing on the market or when deployers interact with the model. According to 
the state of the art at the time of entry into force of this Regulation, the cumulative 
amount of computation used for the training of the general-purpose AI model measured 
in floating point operations is one of the relevant approximations for model capabilities. 
The cumulative amount of computation used for training includes the computation used 
across the activities and methods that are intended to enhance the capabilities of the 
model prior to deployment, such as pre-training, synthetic data generation and fine-
tuning. Therefore, an initial threshold of floating point operations should be set, which, 
if met by a general-purpose AI model, leads to a presumption that the model is a 
general-purpose AI model with systemic risks. This threshold should be adjusted over 
time to reflect technological and industrial changes, such as algorithmic improvements 
or increased hardware efficiency, and should be supplemented with benchmarks and 
indicators for model capability.

Document 113: EN
United in diversity
EN
(112)
It is also necessary to clarify a procedure for the classification of a general-purpose AI 
model with systemic risks. A general-purpose AI model that meets the applicable 
threshold for high-impact capabilities should be presumed to be a general-purpose AI 
models with systemic risk. The provider should notify the AI Office at the latest two 
weeks after the requirements are met or it becomes known that a general-purpose AI 
model will meet the requirements that lead to the presumption. This is especially relevant 
in relation to the threshold of floating point operations because training of general-
purpose AI models takes considerable planning which includes the upfront allocation of 
compute resources and, therefore, providers of general-purpose AI models are able to 
know if their model would meet the threshold before the training is completed. In the 
context of that notification, the provider should be able to demonstrate that, because of 
its specific characteristics, a general-purpose AI model exceptionally does not present 
systemic risks, and that it thus should not be classified as a general-purpose AI model 
with systemic risks. That information is valuable for the AI Office to anticipate the 
placing on the market of general-purpose AI models with systemic risks and the 
providers can start to engage with the AI Office early on. That information is especially 
important with regard to general-purpose AI models that are planned to be released as 
open-source, given that, after the open-source model release, necessary measures to 
ensure compliance with the obligations under this Regulation may be more difficult to 
implement.

Document 112: EN

EN
To inform this, the AI Office should engage with the scientific community, industry, civil 
society and other experts. Thresholds, as well as tools and benchmarks for the 
assessment of high-impact capabilities, should be strong predictors of generality, its 
capabilities and associated systemic risk of general-purpose AI models, and could take 
into account the way the model will be placed on the market or the number of users it 
may affect. To complement this system, there should be a possibility for the Commission 
to take individual decisions designating a general-purpose AI model as a general-
purpose AI model with systemic risk if it is found that such model has capabilities or an 
impact equivalent to those captured by the set threshold. That decision should be taken 
on the basis of an overall assessment of the criteria for the designation of a general-
purpose AI model with systemic risk set out in an annex to this Regulation, such as 
quality or size of the training data set, number of business and end users, its input and 
output modalities, its level of autonomy and scalability, or the tools it has access to.

purpose AI model with systemic risk, the Commission should take the request into 
account and may decide to reassess whether the general-purpose AI model can still be

It is appropriate that, in order to minimise the burden on operators and avoid any possible 
duplication, for high-risk AI systems related to products which are covered by existing 
Union harmonisation legislation based on the New Legislative Framework, the compliance 
of those AI systems with the requirements of this Regulation should be assessed as part of 
the conformity assessment already provided for in that law. The applicability of the 
requirements of this Regulation should thus not affect the specific logic, methodology or 
general structure of conformity assessment under the relevant Union harmonisation 
legislation. ▌
(125)
Given the complexity of high-risk AI systems and the risks that are associated with them, 
it is important to develop an adequate conformity assessment procedure for high-risk AI 
systems involving notified bodies, so-called third party conformity assessment. However, 
given the current experience of professional pre-market certifiers in the field of product 
safety and the different nature of risks involved, it is appropriate to limit, at least in an 
initial phase of application of this Regulation, the scope of application of third-party 
conformity assessment for high-risk AI systems other than those related to products. 
Therefore, the conformity assessment of such systems should be carried out as a general 
rule by the provider under its own responsibility, with the only exception of AI systems 
intended to be used for biometrics.

High-risk AI systems should only be placed on the Union market, put into service or used 
if they comply with certain mandatory requirements. Those requirements should ensure 
that high-risk AI systems available in the Union or whose output is otherwise used in the 
Union do not pose unacceptable risks to important Union public interests as recognised and 
protected by Union law. On the basis of the New Legislative Framework, as clarified in 
the Commission notice “The ‘Blue Guide’ on the implementation of EU product rules 
2022”20, the general rule is that more than one legal act of Union harmonisation 
legislation, such as Regulations (EU) 2017/74521 and (EU) 2017/74622 of the European 
Parliament and of the Council or Directive 2006/42/EC of the European Parliament and 
of the Council23, may be applicable to one product, since the making available or putting 
into service can take place only when the product complies with all applicable Union 
harmonisation legislation. To ensure consistency and avoid unnecessary administrative 
burdens or costs, providers of a product that contains one or more high-risk AI systems, 
to which the requirements of this Regulation and of the Union harmonisation legislation 
listed in an annex to this Regulation apply, should have flexibility with regard to 
operational decisions on how to ensure compliance of a product that contains one or 
more AI systems with all applicable requirements of the Union harmonisation legislation 
in an optimal manner. AI systems identified as high-risk should be limited to those that 
have a significant harmful impact on the health, safety and fundamental rights of persons 
in the Union and such limitation should minimise any potential restriction to international 
trade.

rights impact assessment prior to putting it into use. Services important for individuals 
that are of public nature may also be provided by private entities. Private entities 
providing such public services are linked to tasks in the public interest such as in the 
areas of education, healthcare, social services, housing, administration of justice. The 
aim of the fundamental rights impact assessment is for the deployer to identify the 
specific risks to the rights of individuals or groups of individuals likely to be affected, 
identify measures to be taken in the case of a materialisation of those risks. The impact 
assessment should be performed prior to deploying the high-risk AI system, and should 
be updated when the deployer considers that any of the relevant factors have changed. 
The impact assessment should identify the deployer’s relevant processes in which the 
high-risk AI system will be used in line with its intended purpose, and should include a

assessment of the impact, including but not limited to the information given by the 
provider of the high-risk AI system in the instructions for use. In light of the risks 
identified, deployers should determine measures to be taken in the case of a 
materialisation of those risks, including for example governance arrangements in that 
specific context of use, such as arrangements for human oversight according to the 
instructions of use or, complaint handling and redress procedures, as they could be 
instrumental in mitigating risks to fundamental rights in concrete use-cases. After 
performing that impact assessment, the deployer should notify the relevant market 
surveillance authority. Where appropriate, to collect relevant information necessary to 
perform the impact assessment, deployers of high-risk AI system, in particular when AI 
systems are used in the public sector, could involve relevant stakeholders, including the 
representatives of groups of persons likely to be affected by the AI system, independent 
experts, and civil society organisations in conducting such impact assessments and

The use of AI systems for real-time remote biometric identification of natural persons in 
publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement necessarily involves the 
processing of biometric data. The rules of this Regulation that prohibit, subject to certain 
exceptions, such use, which are based on Article 16 TFEU, should apply as lex specialis in 
respect of the rules on the processing of biometric data contained in Article 10 of Directive 
(EU) 2016/680, thus regulating such use and the processing of biometric data involved in 
an exhaustive manner. Therefore, such use and processing should be possible only in as far 
as it is compatible with the framework set by this Regulation, without there being scope, 
outside that framework, for the competent authorities, where they act for purpose of law 
enforcement, to use such systems and process such data in connection thereto on the 
grounds listed in Article 10 of Directive (EU) 2016/680. In that context, this Regulation is 
not intended to provide the legal basis for the processing of personal data under Article 8 
of Directive (EU) 2016/680. However, the use of real-time remote biometric identification 
systems in publicly accessible spaces for purposes other than law enforcement, including 
by competent authorities, should not be covered by the specific framework regarding such 
use for the purpose of law enforcement set by this Regulation. Such use for purposes other 
than law enforcement should therefore not be subject to the requirement of an authorisation 
under this Regulation and the applicable detailed rules of national law that may give effect 
to that authorisation.

The use of AI systems for ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification of natural persons in 
publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement is particularly intrusive to 
the rights and freedoms of the concerned persons, to the extent that it may affect the 
private life of a large part of the population, evoke a feeling of constant surveillance and 
indirectly dissuade the exercise of the freedom of assembly and other fundamental rights. 
Technical inaccuracies of AI systems intended for the remote biometric identification of 
natural persons can lead to biased results and entail discriminatory effects. Such 
possible biased results and discriminatory effects are particularly relevant with regard to 
age, ethnicity, race, sex or disabilities. In addition, the immediacy of the impact and the 
limited opportunities for further checks or corrections in relation to the use of such systems 
operating in real-time carry heightened risks for the rights and freedoms of the persons 
concerned in the context of, or impacted by, law enforcement activities.

The use of those systems for the purpose of law enforcement should therefore be 
prohibited, except in exhaustively listed and narrowly defined situations, where the use is 
strictly necessary to achieve a substantial public interest, the importance of which 
outweighs the risks. Those situations involve the search for certain victims of crime ▌ 
including missing persons; certain threats to the life or to the physical safety of natural 
persons or of a terrorist attack; and the localisation or identification of perpetrators or 
suspects of the criminal offences listed in an annex to this Regulation, where those 
criminal offences are punishable in the Member State concerned by a custodial sentence or 
a detention order for a maximum period of at least four years and as they are defined in the

A Union legal framework laying down harmonised rules on AI is therefore needed to foster 
the development, use and uptake of AI in the internal market that at the same time meets a 
high level of protection of public interests, such as health and safety and the protection of 
fundamental rights, including democracy, the rule of law and environmental protection 
as recognised and protected by Union law. To achieve that objective, rules regulating the 
placing on the market, the putting into service and the use of certain AI systems should be 
laid down, thus ensuring the smooth functioning of the internal market and allowing those 
systems to benefit from the principle of free movement of goods and services. Those rules 
should be clear and robust in protecting fundamental rights, supportive of new 
innovative solutions, enabling a European ecosystem of public and private actors 
creating AI systems in line with Union values and unlocking the potential of the digital 
transformation across all regions of the Union. By laying down those rules as well as 
measures in support of innovation with a particular focus on small and medium 
enterprises (SMEs), including startups, this Regulation supports the objective of 
promoting the European human-centric approach to AI and being a global leader in the 
development of secure, trustworthy and ethical AI ▌ as stated by the European Council5,

(28)
Aside from the many beneficial uses of AI, it can also be misused and provide novel and 
powerful tools for manipulative, exploitative and social control practices. Such practices 
are particularly harmful and abusive and should be prohibited because they contradict 
Union values of respect for human dignity, freedom, equality, democracy and the rule of 
law and fundamental rights enshrined in the Charter, including the right to non-
discrimination, to data protection and to privacy and the rights of the child.
(29)
AI-enabled manipulative techniques can be used to persuade persons to engage in 
unwanted behaviours, or to deceive them by nudging them into decisions in a way that 
subverts and impairs their autonomy, decision-making and free choices. The placing on 
the market, the putting into service or the use of certain AI systems with the objective to or 
the effect of materially distorting human behaviour, whereby significant harms, in 
particular having sufficiently important adverse impacts on physical, psychological 
health or financial interests are likely to occur, are particularly dangerous and should 
therefore be prohibited. Such AI systems deploy subliminal components such as audio, 
image, video stimuli that persons cannot perceive, as those stimuli are beyond human 
perception, or other manipulative or deceptive techniques that subvert or impair person’s 
autonomy, decision-making or free choice in ways that people are not consciously aware 
of those techniques or, where they are aware of them, can still be deceived or are not 
able to control or resist them. This could be facilitated, for example, by machine-brain 
interfaces or virtual reality as they allow for a higher degree of control of what stimuli 
are presented to persons, insofar as they may materially distort their behaviour in a 
significantly harmful manner. In addition, AI systems may also otherwise exploit the 
vulnerabilities of a person or a specific group of persons due to their age, disability within 
the meaning of Directive (EU) 2019/882 of the European Parliament and of the 
Council16, or a specific social or economic situation that is likely to make those persons 
more vulnerable to exploitation such as persons living in extreme poverty, ethnic or 
religious minorities.",[],"{'question_type': 'vague', 'seed_document_id': 29, 'topic': 'AI Regulation and Ethics'}","According to the EU AI Act, there are several potential risks associated with the use of AI systems, including:

1. Systemic risks: These include negative effects on major accidents, disruptions of critical sectors, serious consequences to public health and safety, negative effects on democratic processes, public and economic security, and the dissemination of illegal, false, or discriminatory content.

2. Harm to health and safety: The use of AI systems could cause harm to health and safety, which could have an adverse impact on fundamental rights or give rise to significant concerns in relation to the likelihood of such harm or adverse impact.

3. Disproportionate impact: AI systems could disproportionately affect a particular group of persons, and persons who are potentially harmed or suffer an adverse impact may be dependent on the outcome produced with an AI system.

4. Imbalance of power: Persons who are potentially harmed or suffer an adverse impact may be in a vulnerable position in relation to the deployer of an AI system, due to status, authority, knowledge, economic or social circumstances, or age.

Each use of a ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification system in publicly accessible 
spaces for the purpose of law enforcement should be subject to an express and specific 
authorisation by a judicial authority or by an independent administrative authority of a 
Member State whose decision is binding. Such authorisation should, in principle, be 
obtained prior to the use of the AI system with a view to identifying a person or persons. 
Exceptions to that rule should be allowed in duly justified situations on grounds of 
urgency, namely in situations where the need to use the systems concerned is such as to 
make it effectively and objectively impossible to obtain an authorisation before 
commencing the use of the AI system. In such situations of urgency, the use of the AI 
system should be restricted to the absolute minimum necessary and should be subject to 
appropriate safeguards and conditions, as determined in national law and specified in the 
context of each individual urgent use case by the law enforcement authority itself. In 
addition, the law enforcement authority should in such situations request such 
authorisation ▌ while providing the reasons for not having been able to request it earlier, 
without undue delay and at the latest within 24 hours. If such an authorisation is 
rejected, the use of real-time biometric identification systems linked to that authorisation 
should cease with immediate effect and all the data related to such use should be 
discarded and deleted. Such data includes input data directly acquired by an AI system 
in the course of the use of such system as well as the results and outputs of the use 
linked to that authorisation. It should not include input that is legally acquired in 
accordance with another Union or national law. In any case, no decision producing an 
adverse legal effect on a person should be taken based solely on the output of the remote 
biometric identification system.

For the purposes of paragraph 1, first subparagraph, point (h) and paragraph 2, each ▌ use

authority or ▌ an independent administrative authority whose decision is binding of the 
Member State in which the use is to take place, issued upon a reasoned request and in 
accordance with the detailed rules of national law referred to in paragraph 5. However, in a 
duly justified situation of urgency, the use of such system may be commenced without an 
authorisation provided that such authorisation is requested without undue delay, at the 
latest within 24 hours. If such authorisation is rejected, the use shall be stopped with 
immediate effect and all the data, as well as the results and outputs of that use shall be 
immediately discarded and deleted.
The competent judicial authority or an independent administrative authority whose 
decision is binding shall grant the authorisation only where it is satisfied, on the basis of 
objective evidence or clear indications presented to it, that the use of the ‘real-time’ remote 
biometric identification system concerned is necessary for, and proportionate to, achieving 
one of the objectives specified in paragraph 1, first subparagraph, point (h), as identified in

The use of AI systems for real-time remote biometric identification of natural persons in 
publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement necessarily involves the 
processing of biometric data. The rules of this Regulation that prohibit, subject to certain 
exceptions, such use, which are based on Article 16 TFEU, should apply as lex specialis in 
respect of the rules on the processing of biometric data contained in Article 10 of Directive 
(EU) 2016/680, thus regulating such use and the processing of biometric data involved in 
an exhaustive manner. Therefore, such use and processing should be possible only in as far 
as it is compatible with the framework set by this Regulation, without there being scope, 
outside that framework, for the competent authorities, where they act for purpose of law 
enforcement, to use such systems and process such data in connection thereto on the 
grounds listed in Article 10 of Directive (EU) 2016/680. In that context, this Regulation is 
not intended to provide the legal basis for the processing of personal data under Article 8 
of Directive (EU) 2016/680. However, the use of real-time remote biometric identification 
systems in publicly accessible spaces for purposes other than law enforcement, including 
by competent authorities, should not be covered by the specific framework regarding such 
use for the purpose of law enforcement set by this Regulation. Such use for purposes other 
than law enforcement should therefore not be subject to the requirement of an authorisation 
under this Regulation and the applicable detailed rules of national law that may give effect 
to that authorisation.

The use of AI systems for ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification of natural persons in 
publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement is particularly intrusive to 
the rights and freedoms of the concerned persons, to the extent that it may affect the 
private life of a large part of the population, evoke a feeling of constant surveillance and 
indirectly dissuade the exercise of the freedom of assembly and other fundamental rights. 
Technical inaccuracies of AI systems intended for the remote biometric identification of 
natural persons can lead to biased results and entail discriminatory effects. Such 
possible biased results and discriminatory effects are particularly relevant with regard to 
age, ethnicity, race, sex or disabilities. In addition, the immediacy of the impact and the 
limited opportunities for further checks or corrections in relation to the use of such systems 
operating in real-time carry heightened risks for the rights and freedoms of the persons 
concerned in the context of, or impacted by, law enforcement activities.
(33)
The use of those systems for the purpose of law enforcement should therefore be 
prohibited, except in exhaustively listed and narrowly defined situations, where the use is 
strictly necessary to achieve a substantial public interest, the importance of which 
outweighs the risks. Those situations involve the search for certain victims of crime ▌ 
including missing persons; certain threats to the life or to the physical safety of natural 
persons or of a terrorist attack; and the localisation or identification of perpetrators or 
suspects of the criminal offences listed in an annex to this Regulation, where those 
criminal offences are punishable in the Member State concerned by a custodial sentence or 
a detention order for a maximum period of at least four years and as they are defined in the 
law of that Member State. Such a threshold for the custodial sentence or detention order in

High-risk AI systems should only be placed on the Union market, put into service or used 
if they comply with certain mandatory requirements. Those requirements should ensure 
that high-risk AI systems available in the Union or whose output is otherwise used in the 
Union do not pose unacceptable risks to important Union public interests as recognised and 
protected by Union law. On the basis of the New Legislative Framework, as clarified in 
the Commission notice “The ‘Blue Guide’ on the implementation of EU product rules 
2022”20, the general rule is that more than one legal act of Union harmonisation 
legislation, such as Regulations (EU) 2017/74521 and (EU) 2017/74622 of the European 
Parliament and of the Council or Directive 2006/42/EC of the European Parliament and 
of the Council23, may be applicable to one product, since the making available or putting 
into service can take place only when the product complies with all applicable Union 
harmonisation legislation. To ensure consistency and avoid unnecessary administrative 
burdens or costs, providers of a product that contains one or more high-risk AI systems, 
to which the requirements of this Regulation and of the Union harmonisation legislation 
listed in an annex to this Regulation apply, should have flexibility with regard to 
operational decisions on how to ensure compliance of a product that contains one or 
more AI systems with all applicable requirements of the Union harmonisation legislation 
in an optimal manner. AI systems identified as high-risk should be limited to those that 
have a significant harmful impact on the health, safety and fundamental rights of persons 
in the Union and such limitation should minimise any potential restriction to international 
trade.

In order to efficiently ensure that fundamental rights are protected, deployers of high-
risk AI systems that are bodies governed by public law, or private entities providing 
public services and deployers of certain high-risk AI systems listed in an annex to this 
Regulation, such as banking or insurance entities, should carry out a fundamental 
rights impact assessment prior to putting it into use. Services important for individuals 
that are of public nature may also be provided by private entities. Private entities 
providing such public services are linked to tasks in the public interest such as in the 
areas of education, healthcare, social services, housing, administration of justice. The 
aim of the fundamental rights impact assessment is for the deployer to identify the 
specific risks to the rights of individuals or groups of individuals likely to be affected, 
identify measures to be taken in the case of a materialisation of those risks. The impact 
assessment should be performed prior to deploying the high-risk AI system, and should 
be updated when the deployer considers that any of the relevant factors have changed. 
The impact assessment should identify the deployer’s relevant processes in which the 
high-risk AI system will be used in line with its intended purpose, and should include a 
description of the period of time and frequency in which the system is intended to be 
used as well as of specific categories of natural persons and groups who are likely to be 
affected in the specific context of use.

Document 100: EN

The assessment should also include the identification of specific risks of harm likely to 
have an impact on the fundamental rights of those persons or groups. While performing 
this assessment, the deployer should take into account information relevant to a proper 
assessment of the impact, including but not limited to the information given by the 
provider of the high-risk AI system in the instructions for use. In light of the risks 
identified, deployers should determine measures to be taken in the case of a 
materialisation of those risks, including for example governance arrangements in that 
specific context of use, such as arrangements for human oversight according to the 
instructions of use or, complaint handling and redress procedures, as they could be 
instrumental in mitigating risks to fundamental rights in concrete use-cases. After 
performing that impact assessment, the deployer should notify the relevant market 
surveillance authority. Where appropriate, to collect relevant information necessary to 
perform the impact assessment, deployers of high-risk AI system, in particular when AI 
systems are used in the public sector, could involve relevant stakeholders, including the 
representatives of groups of persons likely to be affected by the AI system, independent 
experts, and civil society organisations in conducting such impact assessments and

Technical robustness is a key requirement for high-risk AI systems. They should be 
resilient in relation to harmful or otherwise undesirable behaviour that may result from 
limitations within the systems or the environment in which the systems operate (e.g. 
errors, faults, inconsistencies, unexpected situations). Therefore, technical and 
organisational measures should be taken to ensure robustness of high-risk AI systems, 
for example by designing and developing appropriate technical solutions to prevent or 
minimize harmful or otherwise undesirable behaviour. Those technical solution may 
include for instance mechanisms enabling the system to safely interrupt its operation 
(fail-safe plans) in the presence of certain anomalies or when operation takes place 
outside certain predetermined boundaries. Failure to protect against these risks could lead 
to safety impacts or negatively affect the fundamental rights, for example due to erroneous 
decisions or wrong or biased outputs generated by the AI system.
(76)
Cybersecurity plays a crucial role in ensuring that AI systems are resilient against attempts 
to alter their use, behaviour, performance or compromise their security properties by 
malicious third parties exploiting the system’s vulnerabilities. Cyberattacks against AI 
systems can leverage AI specific assets, such as training data sets (e.g. data poisoning) or 
trained models (e.g. adversarial attacks or membership inference), or exploit 
vulnerabilities in the AI system’s digital assets or the underlying ICT infrastructure. To 
ensure a level of cybersecurity appropriate to the risks, suitable measures, such as security 
controls, should therefore be taken by the providers of high-risk AI systems, also taking 
into account as appropriate the underlying ICT infrastructure.",[],"{'question_type': 'situational', 'seed_document_id': 84, 'situational_context': 'Amidst the labyrinth of regulations for high-risk AI systems, a legal consultant meticulously researches the EU AI Act to ensure compliance and safeguard fundamental rights against potential cybersecurity threats.', 'topic': 'High-Risk AI Systems'}","As a legal consultant, you should advise your clients to take the following measures to ensure the robustness of high-risk AI systems in accordance with the EU AI Act:

closely aligned with the work of international organisations working on AI to ensure 
legal certainty, facilitate international convergence and wide acceptance, while providing 
the flexibility to accommodate the rapid technological developments in this field. 
Moreover, the definition should be based on key characteristics of AI systems that 
distinguish it from simpler traditional software systems or programming approaches and 
should not cover systems that are based on the rules defined solely by natural persons to 
automatically execute operations. A key characteristic of AI systems is their capability to 
infer. This capability to infer refers to the process of obtaining the outputs, such as 
predictions, content, recommendations, or decisions, which can influence physical and 
virtual environments, and to a capability of AI systems to derive models or algorithms, or 
both, from inputs or data. The techniques that enable inference while building an AI 
system include machine learning approaches that learn from data how to achieve certain 
objectives, and logic- and knowledge-based approaches that infer from encoded 
knowledge or symbolic representation of the task to be solved. The capacity of an AI

involving the training of models are used, with a view to ensure that the high-risk AI 
system performs as intended and safely and it does not become a source of discrimination

require the implementation of appropriate data governance and management practices. 
Data sets for training, validation and testing, including the labels, should be relevant,

risk AI systems that are bodies governed by public law, or private entities providing 
public services and deployers of certain high-risk AI systems listed in an annex to this 
Regulation, such as banking or insurance entities, should carry out a fundamental 
rights impact assessment prior to putting it into use. Services important for individuals 
that are of public nature may also be provided by private entities. Private entities 
providing such public services are linked to tasks in the public interest such as in the 
areas of education, healthcare, social services, housing, administration of justice. The 
aim of the fundamental rights impact assessment is for the deployer to identify the 
specific risks to the rights of individuals or groups of individuals likely to be affected, 
identify measures to be taken in the case of a materialisation of those risks. The impact 
assessment should be performed prior to deploying the high-risk AI system, and should 
be updated when the deployer considers that any of the relevant factors have changed.

"What is a 'remote biometric identification system' as defined in the Regulation, and how do 'real-time' systems differ from 'post' systems in biometric identification?","A 'remote biometric identification system' is an AI system for identifying individuals without their active involvement by comparing biometric data to a reference database, while 'real-time' systems perform capturing, comparison, and identification instantaneously, unlike 'post' systems which involve a delay after data capture.","Document 17: EN
United in diversity
EN
(17)
The notion of ‘remote biometric identification system’ referred to in this Regulation should 
be defined functionally, as an AI system intended for the identification of natural persons 
without their active involvement, typically at a distance, through the comparison of a 
person’s biometric data with the biometric data contained in a reference database, 
irrespectively of the particular technology, processes or types of biometric data used. 
Such remote biometric identification systems are typically used to perceive multiple 
persons or their behaviour simultaneously in order to facilitate significantly the 
identification of natural persons without their active involvement. This excludes AI 
systems intended to be used for biometric verification, which includes authentication, the 
sole purpose of which is to confirm that a specific natural person is the person he or she 
claims to be and to confirm the identity of a natural person for the sole purpose of 
having access to a service, unlocking a device or having security access to premises. 
That exclusion is justified by the fact that such systems are likely to have a minor impact 
on fundamental rights of natural persons compared to the remote biometric 
identification systems which may be used for the processing of the biometric data of a 
large number of persons without their active involvement. In the case of ‘real-time’ 
systems, the capturing of the biometric data, the comparison and the identification occur all 
instantaneously, near-instantaneously or in any event without a significant delay. In this 
regard, there should be no scope for circumventing the rules of this Regulation on the ‘real-
time’ use of the AI systems concerned by providing for minor delays. ‘Real-time’ systems 
involve the use of ‘live’ or ‘near-live’ material, such as video footage, generated by a 
camera or other device with similar functionality. In the case of ‘post’ systems, in contrast, 
the biometric data has already been captured and the comparison and identification occur 
only after a significant delay. This involves material, such as pictures or video footage 
generated by closed circuit television cameras or private devices, which has been generated 
before the use of the system in respect of the natural persons concerned.",[],"{'question_type': 'double', 'original_questions': [{'question': ""What is a 'remote biometric identification system' as defined in the Regulation?"", 'answer': ""A 'remote biometric identification system' is an AI system intended for the identification of natural persons without their active involvement, typically at a distance, through the comparison of a person’s biometric data with the biometric data contained in a reference database.""}, {'question': ""How do 'real-time' systems differ from 'post' systems in biometric identification?"", 'answer': ""'Real-time' systems involve the capturing of biometric data, comparison, and identification occurring all instantaneously or near-instantaneously, while 'post' systems involve biometric data that has already been captured, with comparison and identification occurring only after a significant delay.""}], 'seed_document_id': 17, 'topic': 'Biometric Data and AI'}","According to the EU AI Act Regulation, a 'remote biometric identification system' is an AI system that is intended for the identification of natural persons without their active involvement, typically at a distance, through the comparison of a person’s biometric data with the biometric data contained in a reference database, irrespective of the particular technology, processes or types of biometric data used.

"What is the purpose of the fundamental rights impact assessment for high-risk AI systems, and who is required to perform it?","The purpose of the fundamental rights impact assessment is to identify specific risks to individuals' rights and necessary measures to mitigate those risks, and it must be performed by deployers governed by public law, private entities providing public services, and certain high-risk AI system deployers like banking or insurance entities.","Document 100: EN
United in diversity
EN
The assessment should also include the identification of specific risks of harm likely to 
have an impact on the fundamental rights of those persons or groups. While performing 
this assessment, the deployer should take into account information relevant to a proper 
assessment of the impact, including but not limited to the information given by the 
provider of the high-risk AI system in the instructions for use. In light of the risks 
identified, deployers should determine measures to be taken in the case of a 
materialisation of those risks, including for example governance arrangements in that 
specific context of use, such as arrangements for human oversight according to the 
instructions of use or, complaint handling and redress procedures, as they could be 
instrumental in mitigating risks to fundamental rights in concrete use-cases. After 
performing that impact assessment, the deployer should notify the relevant market 
surveillance authority. Where appropriate, to collect relevant information necessary to 
perform the impact assessment, deployers of high-risk AI system, in particular when AI 
systems are used in the public sector, could involve relevant stakeholders, including the 
representatives of groups of persons likely to be affected by the AI system, independent 
experts, and civil society organisations in conducting such impact assessments and 
designing measures to be taken in the case of materialisation of the risks. The European 
Artificial Intelligence Office (AI Office) should develop a template for a questionnaire in 
order to facilitate compliance and reduce the administrative burden for deployers.

In order to efficiently ensure that fundamental rights are protected, deployers of high-
risk AI systems that are bodies governed by public law, or private entities providing 
public services and deployers of certain high-risk AI systems listed in an annex to this 
Regulation, such as banking or insurance entities, should carry out a fundamental 
rights impact assessment prior to putting it into use. Services important for individuals 
that are of public nature may also be provided by private entities. Private entities 
providing such public services are linked to tasks in the public interest such as in the 
areas of education, healthcare, social services, housing, administration of justice. The 
aim of the fundamental rights impact assessment is for the deployer to identify the 
specific risks to the rights of individuals or groups of individuals likely to be affected, 
identify measures to be taken in the case of a materialisation of those risks. The impact 
assessment should be performed prior to deploying the high-risk AI system, and should 
be updated when the deployer considers that any of the relevant factors have changed. 
The impact assessment should identify the deployer’s relevant processes in which the 
high-risk AI system will be used in line with its intended purpose, and should include a 
description of the period of time and frequency in which the system is intended to be 
used as well as of specific categories of natural persons and groups who are likely to be 
affected in the specific context of use.

Member State whose decision is binding. Such authorisation should, in principle, be 
obtained prior to the use of the AI system with a view to identifying a person or persons. 
Exceptions to that rule should be allowed in duly justified situations on grounds of 
urgency, namely in situations where the need to use the systems concerned is such as to 
make it effectively and objectively impossible to obtain an authorisation before 
commencing the use of the AI system. In such situations of urgency, the use of the AI 
system should be restricted to the absolute minimum necessary and should be subject to 
appropriate safeguards and conditions, as determined in national law and specified in the 
context of each individual urgent use case by the law enforcement authority itself. In 
addition, the law enforcement authority should in such situations request such 
authorisation ▌ while providing the reasons for not having been able to request it earlier, 
without undue delay and at the latest within 24 hours. If such an authorisation is 
rejected, the use of real-time biometric identification systems linked to that authorisation

The use of AI systems for real-time remote biometric identification of natural persons in 
publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement necessarily involves the 
processing of biometric data. The rules of this Regulation that prohibit, subject to certain 
exceptions, such use, which are based on Article 16 TFEU, should apply as lex specialis in 
respect of the rules on the processing of biometric data contained in Article 10 of Directive 
(EU) 2016/680, thus regulating such use and the processing of biometric data involved in 
an exhaustive manner. Therefore, such use and processing should be possible only in as far 
as it is compatible with the framework set by this Regulation, without there being scope, 
outside that framework, for the competent authorities, where they act for purpose of law 
enforcement, to use such systems and process such data in connection thereto on the 
grounds listed in Article 10 of Directive (EU) 2016/680. In that context, this Regulation is 
not intended to provide the legal basis for the processing of personal data under Article 8 
of Directive (EU) 2016/680. However, the use of real-time remote biometric identification 
systems in publicly accessible spaces for purposes other than law enforcement, including 
by competent authorities, should not be covered by the specific framework regarding such 
use for the purpose of law enforcement set by this Regulation. Such use for purposes other 
than law enforcement should therefore not be subject to the requirement of an authorisation 
under this Regulation and the applicable detailed rules of national law that may give effect 
to that authorisation.

the rights and freedoms of the concerned persons, to the extent that it may affect the 
private life of a large part of the population, evoke a feeling of constant surveillance and 
indirectly dissuade the exercise of the freedom of assembly and other fundamental rights. 
Technical inaccuracies of AI systems intended for the remote biometric identification of 
natural persons can lead to biased results and entail discriminatory effects. Such 
possible biased results and discriminatory effects are particularly relevant with regard to 
age, ethnicity, race, sex or disabilities. In addition, the immediacy of the impact and the

a detention order for a maximum period of at least four years and as they are defined in the

To mitigate the risks from high-risk AI systems placed on the market or put into service 
and to ensure a high level of trustworthiness, certain mandatory requirements should 
apply to high-risk AI systems, taking into account the intended purpose and the context of 
use of the AI system and according to the risk-management system to be established by the 
provider. The measures adopted by the providers to comply with the mandatory 
requirements of this Regulation should take into account the generally acknowledged 
state of the art on AI, be proportionate and effective to meet the objectives of this 
Regulation. Based on the New Legislative Framework, as clarified in Commission notice 
“The ‘Blue Guide’ on the implementation of EU product rules 2022”, the general rule is 
that more than one legal act of Union harmonisation legislation may be applicable to 
one product, since the making available or putting into service can take place only when 
the product complies with all applicable Union harmonisation legislation. The hazards 
of AI systems covered by the requirements of this Regulation concern different aspects 
than the existing Union harmonisation legislation and therefore the requirements of this 
Regulation would complement the existing body of the Union harmonisation legislation. 
For example, machinery or medical devices products incorporating an AI system might 
present risks not addressed by the essential health and safety requirements set out in the 
relevant Union harmonised legislation, as that sectoral law does not deal with risks 
specific to AI systems.

protected by Union law. On the basis of the New Legislative Framework, as clarified in 
the Commission notice “The ‘Blue Guide’ on the implementation of EU product rules

As regards stand-alone AI systems, namely high-risk AI systems other than those that are 
safety components of products, or that are themselves products, it is appropriate to classify 
them as high-risk if, in light of their intended purpose, they pose a high risk of harm to the 
health and safety or the fundamental rights of persons, taking into account both the severity 
of the possible harm and its probability of occurrence and they are used in a number of 
specifically pre-defined areas specified in this Regulation. The identification of those 
systems is based on the same methodology and criteria envisaged also for any future 
amendments of the list of high-risk AI systems that the Commission should be 
empowered to adopt, via delegated acts, to take into account the rapid pace of 
technological development, as well as the potential changes in the use of AI systems.

As regards AI systems that are safety components of products, or which are themselves 
products, falling within the scope of certain Union harmonisation legislation listed in an 
annex to this Regulation, it is appropriate to classify them as high-risk under this 
Regulation if the product concerned undergoes the conformity assessment procedure with a 
third-party conformity assessment body pursuant to that relevant Union harmonisation 
legislation. In particular, such products are machinery, toys, lifts, equipment and protective 
systems intended for use in potentially explosive atmospheres, radio equipment, pressure 
equipment, recreational craft equipment, cableway installations, appliances burning 
gaseous fuels, medical devices, in vitro diagnostic medical devices, automotive and 
aviation.

The classification of an AI system as high-risk pursuant to this Regulation should not 
necessarily mean that the product whose safety component is the AI system, or the AI 
system itself as a product, is considered to be high-risk under the criteria established in the 
relevant Union harmonisation legislation that applies to the product. This is, in particular, 
the case for Regulations (EU) 2017/745 and (EU) 2017/746, where a third-party

Union do not pose unacceptable risks to important Union public interests as recognised and 
protected by Union law. On the basis of the New Legislative Framework, as clarified in 
the Commission notice “The ‘Blue Guide’ on the implementation of EU product rules

legislation, such as Regulations (EU) 2017/74521 and (EU) 2017/74622 of the European 
Parliament and of the Council or Directive 2006/42/EC of the European Parliament and 
of the Council23, may be applicable to one product, since the making available or putting 
into service can take place only when the product complies with all applicable Union 
harmonisation legislation. To ensure consistency and avoid unnecessary administrative 
burdens or costs, providers of a product that contains one or more high-risk AI systems, 
to which the requirements of this Regulation and of the Union harmonisation legislation 
listed in an annex to this Regulation apply, should have flexibility with regard to 
operational decisions on how to ensure compliance of a product that contains one or 
more AI systems with all applicable requirements of the Union harmonisation legislation 
in an optimal manner. AI systems identified as high-risk should be limited to those that 
have a significant harmful impact on the health, safety and fundamental rights of persons

What are the differences?,"Remote biometric identification systems are intended for the identification of natural persons without their active involvement, while biometric verification systems are intended to confirm that a specific natural person is who they claim to be for access to services or security.","Document 17: EN
United in diversity
EN
(17)
The notion of ‘remote biometric identification system’ referred to in this Regulation should 
be defined functionally, as an AI system intended for the identification of natural persons 
without their active involvement, typically at a distance, through the comparison of a 
person’s biometric data with the biometric data contained in a reference database, 
irrespectively of the particular technology, processes or types of biometric data used. 
Such remote biometric identification systems are typically used to perceive multiple 
persons or their behaviour simultaneously in order to facilitate significantly the 
identification of natural persons without their active involvement. This excludes AI 
systems intended to be used for biometric verification, which includes authentication, the 
sole purpose of which is to confirm that a specific natural person is the person he or she 
claims to be and to confirm the identity of a natural person for the sole purpose of 
having access to a service, unlocking a device or having security access to premises. 
That exclusion is justified by the fact that such systems are likely to have a minor impact 
on fundamental rights of natural persons compared to the remote biometric 
identification systems which may be used for the processing of the biometric data of a 
large number of persons without their active involvement. In the case of ‘real-time’ 
systems, the capturing of the biometric data, the comparison and the identification occur all 
instantaneously, near-instantaneously or in any event without a significant delay. In this 
regard, there should be no scope for circumventing the rules of this Regulation on the ‘real-
time’ use of the AI systems concerned by providing for minor delays. ‘Real-time’ systems 
involve the use of ‘live’ or ‘near-live’ material, such as video footage, generated by a 
camera or other device with similar functionality. In the case of ‘post’ systems, in contrast, 
the biometric data has already been captured and the comparison and identification occur 
only after a significant delay. This involves material, such as pictures or video footage 
generated by closed circuit television cameras or private devices, which has been generated 
before the use of the system in respect of the natural persons concerned.","[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'I am looking to understand what distinguishes remote biometric identification systems from biometric verification systems according to the Regulation.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'How can I help you with that?'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'What are the differences?'}]","{'question_type': 'conversational', 'seed_document_id': 17, 'topic': 'Biometric Data and AI'}","According to the EU AI Regulation, remote biometric identification systems are defined as AI systems that are used to identify a natural person based on biometric data collected in a public space, or from a distance, without the person's knowledge or consent. These systems are considered high-risk and are subject to stricter requirements under the Regulation.

On the other hand, biometric verification systems are defined as AI systems that are used to verify the identity of a natural person based on biometric data that is provided by the person themselves, such as a fingerprint or facial recognition for unlocking a smartphone. These systems are considered lower-risk and are subject to less stringent requirements under the Regulation.

In summary, the main difference between remote biometric identification systems and biometric verification systems is the source of the biometric data used for identification.

Aside from the many beneficial uses of AI, it can also be misused and provide novel and 
powerful tools for manipulative, exploitative and social control practices. Such practices 
are particularly harmful and abusive and should be prohibited because they contradict 
Union values of respect for human dignity, freedom, equality, democracy and the rule of 
law and fundamental rights enshrined in the Charter, including the right to non-
discrimination, to data protection and to privacy and the rights of the child.
(29)
AI-enabled manipulative techniques can be used to persuade persons to engage in 
unwanted behaviours, or to deceive them by nudging them into decisions in a way that 
subverts and impairs their autonomy, decision-making and free choices. The placing on 
the market, the putting into service or the use of certain AI systems with the objective to or 
the effect of materially distorting human behaviour, whereby significant harms, in 
particular having sufficiently important adverse impacts on physical, psychological 
health or financial interests are likely to occur, are particularly dangerous and should 
therefore be prohibited. Such AI systems deploy subliminal components such as audio, 
image, video stimuli that persons cannot perceive, as those stimuli are beyond human 
perception, or other manipulative or deceptive techniques that subvert or impair person’s 
autonomy, decision-making or free choice in ways that people are not consciously aware 
of those techniques or, where they are aware of them, can still be deceived or are not 
able to control or resist them. This could be facilitated, for example, by machine-brain 
interfaces or virtual reality as they allow for a higher degree of control of what stimuli 
are presented to persons, insofar as they may materially distort their behaviour in a 
significantly harmful manner. In addition, AI systems may also otherwise exploit the 
vulnerabilities of a person or a specific group of persons due to their age, disability within 
the meaning of Directive (EU) 2019/882 of the European Parliament and of the 
Council16, or a specific social or economic situation that is likely to make those persons 
more vulnerable to exploitation such as persons living in extreme poverty, ethnic or 
religious minorities.","[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'I am looking for something that should be prohibited due to its harmful and abusive nature according to the text.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'How can I help you with that?'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'What is that?'}]","{'question_type': 'conversational', 'seed_document_id': 29, 'topic': 'AI Regulation and Ethics'}","I'm sorry, I cannot answer your question without more context.
