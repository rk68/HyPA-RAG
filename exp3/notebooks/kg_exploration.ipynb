    "## Knowledge Graph Exploration Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is a brief exploration and tests of several different knowledge graph methods including property graph and knowledge graph index from LlamaIndex, langchain's knowledge graph and Microsoft's GraphRAG implmentation to assess cost, feasibility, ease-of-use, compatibility, performance etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimate conclusion was to use LLamaIndex's KnowledgeGraphIndex or PropertyGraphIndex as GraphRAG was quite expnesive and often timed out for bigger queries and though LangChain worked well it was hard to incorporate with our existing code."

Statement of Basis and Purpose    The Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (“DCWP” or “Department”) is adding rules to implement  new legislation regarding automated employment decision tools (“AEDT”). Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits  employers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has  been subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly  available, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.      These rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and  sex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”)  pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the\\n----\\n”)  pursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to  determine an impact ratio.

These rules generally clarify obligations  of employers and employment agencies under the new law.    Specifically, these new rules will:  \\uf0b7  Define terms;  \\uf0b7  Clarify the requirements for a bias audit;   \\uf0b7  Clarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;   \\uf0b7  Clarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees  and candidates for employment; and   \\uf0b7  Clarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.

      "A bias audit is a process used to evaluate automated employment decision tools (AEDTs) to ensure they do not unfairly discriminate against individuals based on categories such as race or gender. This involves calculating metrics like the impact ratio, which compares the selection rate for a specific category to the selection rate of the most selected category. The audit also examines the selection rate, which is the rate at which individuals in a category are chosen to advance in the hiring process, and the scoring rate, which is the rate at which individuals in a category receive a score above the sample’s median score. The primary goal of a bias audit is to identify and mitigate any biases that may arise from the use of these automated tools, ensuring fair treatment across different demographic groups.\n"

\\n(2) Calculate the impact ratio for each category; \\n(3) Ensure that the calculations required in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision separately \\ncalculate the impact of the AEDT on: \\ni. Sex categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of male candidates vs female candidates),  \\nii. Race/Ethnicity categories (e.g., impact ratio for selection of Hispanic or Latino \\ncandidates vs Black or African American [Not Hispanic or Latino] candidates), and \\niii. intersectional categories of sex, ethnicity, and race (e.g., impact ratio for selection of \\nHispanic or Latino male candidates vs. Not Hispanic or Latino Black or African American \\nfemale candidates). \\n(4) Ensure that the calculations in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision are performed for \\neach group, if an AEDT classifies candidates for employment or employees being considered \\nfor promotion into specified groups (e.g., leadership styles); and \\n(5) Indicate the number of individuals the AEDT assessed that are not included in the required \\ncalculations because they fall within an unknown category. \\n \\nExample: An employer wants to use an AEDT to screen resumes and schedule interviews for a job \\nposting. To do so, the employer must ensure that a bias audit of the AEDT was conducted no more than \\na year before the planned use of the AEDT. This bias audit is necessary even though the employer is not \\nusing the AEDT to make the final hiring decision, but only to screen at an early point in the application \\nprocess.

The bias audit the \\nemployment agency relied on before its first use of the AEDT was conducted 10 months ago using test \\ndata. The employment agency will need an updated bias audit if it will continue to use the AEDT once 12 \\nmonths have passed since the bias audit it first relied on was conducted. The employment agency’s data \\nfrom 6 months of use of the AEDT is not sufficient on its own to conduct a statistically significant bias \\naudit. The employment agency may rely on a bias audit using the historical data of other employers and \\nemployment agencies if it provides its 6 months of historical data to the independent auditor for use and \\nconsideration. The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. \\n \\nExample 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. \\nThe employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT.

      "1. **Bias Audit Requirement**: Employers and employment agencies are prohibited from using AEDTs unless the tool has undergone a bias audit within one year of its use. The bias audit must be conducted by an independent auditor and assess the tool's disparate impact on various demographic categories, such as race/ethnicity and sex, as required by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Public Availability of Audit Results**: A summary of the results of the most recent bias audit, along with the distribution date of the tool, must be made publicly available on the employer or employment agency's website before the tool is used.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Notification Requirements**: Employers and employment agencies must notify candidates and employees residing in the city at least ten business days before using an AEDT. The notice must include:\n",
      "   - Information that an AEDT will be used in the assessment or evaluation.\n",
      "   - The job qualifications and characteristics that the AEDT will use in the assessment.\n",
      "   - Information about the type of data collected, the source of such data, and the data retention policy, if not disclosed on the employer or employment agency's website.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Penalties for Non-Compliance**: Violations of the provisions of this subchapter can result in civil penalties ranging from $500 to $1,500 for each violation. Each day of non-compliance is considered a separate violation.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Enforcement**: The corporation counsel or designated persons can initiate actions or proceedings in any court of competent jurisdiction to correct violations, mandate compliance, or seek other appropriate relief.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Effective Date**: The law takes effect on January 1, 2023.\n",

Local Law 144 of 2021 prohibits \\nemployers and employment agencies from using an automated employment decision tool unless the tool has \\nbeen subject to a bias audit within one year of the use of the tool, information about the bias audit is publicly \\navailable, and certain notices have been provided to employees or job candidates.   \\n \\nThese rules establish that a bias audit of an AEDT must calculate the selection rate for each race/ethnicity and \\nsex category that is required to be reported on to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) \\npursuant to the EEO Component 1 report, and compare the selection rates to the most selected category to \\ndetermine an impact ratio. These calculations are consistent with Section 1607.4 of the EEOC Uniform \\nGuidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. See 29 C.F.R. § 1607.4. These rules generally clarify obligations \\nof employers and employment agencies under the new law. \\n \\nSpecifically, these new rules will: \\n\\uf0b7 \\nDefine terms; \\n\\uf0b7 \\nClarify the requirements for a bias audit;  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nClarify the requirements for the published results of the required bias audit;  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nClarify the requirements for notices that employers and employment agencies must provide to employees \\nand candidates for employment; and  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nClarify other obligations for the employer or employment agency.  \\n \\nThe Department initially proposed a version of these rules in September 2022. The Department received \\ncomments from the public, including from employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and \\nadvocacy organizations. Various issues raised in the comments led to a second version of the proposed rules, \\npublished in December 2022. Those changes included:  \\n\\uf0b7 \\nModifying the definition of AEDT to ensure greater focus; \\n\\uf0b7 \\nClarifying that an “independent auditor” may not be employed or have a financial interest in an employer \\nor employment agency that seeks to use or continue to use an AEDT or in a vendor that developed or \\ndistributed the AEDT; \\n\\uf0b7 \\nRevising the required calculation to be performed where an AEDT scores candidates;', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=3140, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='58f6bfb0-4a47-4723-a8db-701742c7a743', embedding=None, metadata={'total_pages': 10, 'file_path': '../legal_data/LL144/LL144.pdf', 'source': '2'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='71cc47d3-fb36-466e-8616-8d8aba496a18', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'total_pages': 10, 'file_path': '../legal_data/LL144/LL144.pdf', 'source': '2'}, hash='2b38b47777cc1d389dcd0106ec727db0a797b28baa17086826998b94a3cb3e28')}, text='2 \\n \\n\\uf0b7 \\nClarifying that the required “impact ratio” must be calculated separately to compare sex categories, \\nrace/ethnicity categories, and intersectional categories; \\n\\uf0b7 \\nClarifying the types of data that may be used to conduct a bias audit; \\n\\uf0b7 \\nClarifying that multiple employers using the same AEDT may rely on the same bias audit so long as they \\nprovide historical data, if available, for the independent auditor to consider in such bias audit; and \\n\\uf0b7 \\nClarifying that an AEDT may not be used if its most recent bias audit is more than a year old; \\n \\nThe Department received comments about the second version of the proposed rule from the public, including \\nfrom employers, employment agencies, law firms, AEDT developers, and advocacy organizations.

A bias audit conducted pursuant to section 5-301 of this Chapter must use historical \\ndata of the AEDT. The historical data used to conduct a bias audit may be from one or more employers \\nor employment agencies that use the AEDT. However, an individual employer or employment agency \\nmay rely on a bias audit of an AEDT that uses the historical data of other employers or employment \\nagencies only in the following circumstances: if such employer or employment agency provided historical \\ndata from its own use of the AEDT to the independent auditor conducting the bias audit or if such \\nemployer or employment agency has never used the AEDT. \\n(b) Test Data. Notwithstanding the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section, an employer or \\nemployment agency may rely on a bias audit that uses test data if insufficient historical data is available \\nto conduct a statistically significant bias audit. If a bias audit uses test data, the summary of results of the \\nbias audit must explain why historical data was not used and describe how the test data used was \\ngenerated and obtained.  \\n \\nExample 1: An employer is planning to use an AEDT for the first time.

The employment agency may also rely on a bias audit that uses test data. \\n \\nExample 3: An employer has been using an AEDT for 3 years and will soon need an updated bias audit. \\nThe employer has statistically significant data from its 3 years of use of the AEDT. The employer may \\nrely on a bias audit conducted using historical data from multiple employers if it provides its 3 years of \\nhistorical data to the independent auditor for use and consideration. The employer may also rely on a \\nbias audit conducted using historical data from its own use of the AEDT, without any data from other \\nemployers or employment agencies. The employer may not rely on a bias audit conducted using test \\ndata.  \\n \\n§ 5-303 Published Results. \\n(a) Before the use of an AEDT, an employer or employment agency in the city must make the following \\npublicly available on the employment section of their website in a clear and conspicuous manner:  \\n(1) \\nThe date of the most recent bias audit of the AEDT and a summary of the results, which shall \\ninclude the source and explanation of the data used to conduct the bias audit, the number of \\nindividuals the AEDT assessed that fall within an unknown category, and the number of \\napplicants or candidates, the selection or scoring rates, as applicable, and the impact ratios \\nfor all categories; and, \\n(2) \\nThe distribution date of the AEDT.  \\n(b) The requirements of subdivision (a) of this section may be met with an active hyperlink to a website \\ncontaining the required summary of results and distribution date, provided that the link is clearly identified \\nas a link to results of the bias audit. \\n(c) An employer or employment agency must keep the summary of results and distribution date posted for \\nat least 6 months after its latest use of the AEDT for an employment decision.   \\n \\n§ 5-304 Notice to Candidates and Employees.  \\n(a) The notice required by § 20-871(b)(1) of the Code must include instructions for how an individual can \\nrequest an alternative selection process or a reasonable accommodation under other laws, if \\navailable. Nothing in this subchapter requires an employer or employment agency to provide an \\nalternative selection process. \\n(b) To comply with § 20-871(b)(1) and (2) of the Code, an employer or employment agency may provide \\nnotice to a candidate for employment who resides in the city by doing any of the following: \\n(1) Provide notice on the employment section of its website in a clear and conspicuous manner \\nat least 10 business days before use of an AEDT;  \\n(2) Provide notice in a job posting at least 10 business days before use of an AEDT; or, \\n(3) Provide notice to candidates for employment via U.S. mail or e-mail at least 10 business days \\nbefore use of an AEDT. \\n(c) To comply with § 20-871(b)(1) and (2) of the Code, an employer or employment agency may provide \\nnotice to an employee being considered for promotion who resides in the city by doing any of the \\nfollowing: \\n(1) Provide notice in a written policy or procedure that is provided to employees at least 10 \\nbusiness days before use of an AEDT;', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=3825, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='ec91bc68-e96c-4450-9b9d-0ee632515c68', embedding=None, metadata={'total_pages': 10, 'file_path': '../legal_data/LL144/LL144.pdf', 'source': '10'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='4c77911b-6264-4b52-b865-77b597943e7a', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'total_pages': 10, 'file_path': '../legal_data/LL144/LL144.pdf', 'source': '10'}, hash='ceb07c23abe02c5edfd345dff12ef66ace7f3a467164e7360824bf4555322616')}, text='10 \\n \\n(2) Provide notice in a job posting at least 10 business days before use of an AEDT; or, \\n(3) Provide notice via U.S. mail or e-mail at least 10 business days before use of an AEDT.  \\n(d) To comply with § 20-871(b)(3) of the Code, an employer or employment agency must: \\n(1) Provide information on the employment section of its website in a clear and conspicuous \\nmanner about its AEDT data retention policy, the type of data collected for the AEDT, and the \\nsource of the data; \\n(2) Post instructions on the employment section of its website in a clear and conspicuous manner \\nfor how to make a written request for such information, and if a written request is received, \\nprovide such information within 30 days; and \\n(3) Provide an explanation to a candidate for employment or employee being considered for \\npromotion why disclosure of such information would violate local, state, or federal law, or \\ninterfere with a law enforcement investigation.', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=956, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='6f06c789-dab7-46ab-be7c-a2bc8498978b', embedding=None, metadata={'total_pages': 4, 'file_path': '../legal_data/LL144/LL144_Definitions.pdf', 'source': '1'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='c864fab2-a3a6-4728-a6ca-3deeb2500b72', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'total_pages': 4, 'file_path': '../legal_data/LL144/LL144_Definitions.pdf', 'source': '1'}, hash='79baf7f9c634b2e61677d4fbe60cee90e4ca3cbe3616c852a340a7b2f682e4c3')}, text='The New York City Council\\nLegislation Text\\nCity Hall\\nNew York, NY  10007\\nInt.

      "Mr O’Brien said Mr Brady had taken part in “an act of theatre” that was “obviously choreographed”.\n",
      "Around 2,000 retained firefighters around the country staged a second day of industrial action on Tuesday and are due to start all out-strike action from next Tuesday. The mostly part-time workers, who keep the services going outside of Ireland’s larger urban centres, are taking industrial action in a dispute over pay and working conditions.\n",
      "Speaking in the Dáil, Sinn Féin deputy leader Pearse Doherty said firefighters had marched on Leinster House today and were “very angry” at “the fact the Government will not intervene”.\n",

      "“I’m also asking you, and challenging you, to go outside after this Order of Business and meet with the firefighters because they are just fed up to the hilt in relation to what you said.\n",
      "“Some of them have handed in their pagers to members of the Opposition and have challenged you to wear the pager for the next number of weeks, put up with an €8,600 retainer and not leave your community for the two and a half kilometres and see how you can stand over those type of pay and conditions.”\n",
      "At this point, Mr Brady got up from his seat, walked across the chamber and placed the pager on the desk in front of Mr O’Brien. Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl said the Sinn Féin TD was “completely out of order” and told him not to “carry out a charade in this House”, adding it was “absolutely outrageous behaviour and not to be encouraged”.\n",

      "Epic’s latest tool can animate hyperrealistic MetaHumans with an iPhone: Today, Epic is releasing a new tool designed to capture an actor’s facial performance using a device as simple as an iPhone and apply it to a hyperrealistic “MetaHuman” in the Unreal Engine in “minutes.” The feature, dubbed MetaHuman Animator, was detailed at the Game Developers Conference in March but is now available for developers to try out for themselves. Epic has also released a new video today produced by one of its internal teams to show what the tool is capable of.\n",
      "While Epic’s short film shows off some impressively subtle facial animation, the big benefit the company is emphasizing is the speed with which MetaHuman Animator produces results. “The animation is produced locally using GPU hardware, with the final animation available in minutes,” the company’s press release reads. That has the potential to not just save a studio money by making performance capture more efficient but also, Epic argues, it could allow them to experiment and be more creative.\n",
      "“Need an actor to give you more, dig into a different emotion, or simply explore a new direction?” Epic’s press release asks. “Have them do another take. You’ll be able to review the results in about the time it takes to make a cup of coffee.” Facial animation can be applied to a MetaHuman character “in just a few clicks,” Epic says, and the system is even smart enough to animate a character’s tongue based on the performance’s audio.\n",
      "Performance capture using iPhones has been possible in the Unreal Engine since at least 2020 with the launch of Epic’s Live Link Face iOS app, but now, it’s combined with the high level of detail promised by Epic’s MetaHuman technology. As well as working on the iPhone 12 and up (which is capable of capturing both video and depth data), Epic says MetaHuman Animator can also be used with “existing vertical stereo head-mounted camera [systems] to achieve even greater fidelity.”\n",
      "Epic says the Blue Dot short film released today should give some idea of what its animation tool is capable of. It was produced by Epic Games’ 3Lateral team and stars actor Radivoje Bukvić delivering a monologue based on a poem by Mika Antić. Although Epic says it’s possible to tweak animation post-capture, it claims “minimal interventions” were made on top of the MetaHuman Animator’s performance capture to achieve these results.\n",
      "If you want to learn more, Epic has released an instructional video on how to use the tool. Documentation is also available via the MetaHuman hub on the Epic Developer Community.\n",
      "EU to Ban Huawei, ZTE from Internal Commission Networks: The European Commission is planning to ban equipment from Chinese vendors Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp. from its own internal telecommunications networks, people familiar with the matter said.\n",
      "The ban comes ahead of an anticipated update to the European Union’s guidance on 5G mobile networks within the bloc that’s expected to more forcefully encourage members to phase out equipment from the companies, which it considers high risk, the people said, asking not to be identified because the plan isn’t yet public.\n",
      "As the relationship between the US and its allies and China has deteriorated, countries have blocked Chinese technology from their core telecommunications networks because of spying concerns. The move is similar to the commission’s decision to block its staff from using TikTok Inc. over security concerns related to the social-media app’s data-collection practices.\n",

      "“I contacted him just to see if it was OK with him and he was just a brilliant guy, he let me wear it and was just so nice about it, so I’m very grateful to him.\n",

      "Ryanair has sacked its chief pilot after an investigation into his alleged sexual harassment of female colleagues.\n",
      "The airline told staff that he had been fired for \"a pattern of repeated inappropriate and unacceptable behaviour towards a number of female pilots\".\n",
      "The chief pilot, named in reports as Aidan Murray was appointed in 2020 and had been with the airline for 28 years.\n",
      "Ryanair declined to comment \"on queries relating to individual employees\".\n",
      "According to The Independent, Mr Murray allegedly harassed nine junior colleagues, including sending text messages to some with comments on their bodies.\n",
      "Mr Murray, 58, is also accused of altering flight rosters to fly with certain female pilots.\n",
      "In a note to staff, Ryanair's chief people officer, Darrell Hughes, said Mr Murray's employment had been \"terminated with immediate effect\".\n",
      "An investigation found his behaviour \"was in breach of our anti-harassment policy\". Ryanair said staff should be able to come to work \"in a safe and secure environment\".\n",
      "\"We would ask all of you to respect the privacy and integrity of those brave individuals who came forward to assist us in this investigation,\" Mr Hughes added.\n",
      "The Financial Times reported that Mr Murray has seven days to launch an appeal against his dismissal.\n",
      "The BBC has attempted to contact Mr Murray for comment.\n",
      "The job of chief pilot is an important one. The holder is both a highly qualified airline captain and a manager, responsible for overseeing other pilots based at a hub airport.\n",
      "They are usually in charge of issues such as training, flight coordination and rostering as well as addressing personal issues. They can also represent the airline in disciplinary issues.\n",
      "As such, they have a lot of power over their fellow pilots, particularly more junior ones seeking promotions.\n",
      "The suggestion that someone in this position might be abusing their power - and behaving in an \"inappropriate and unacceptable\" way towards female staff - is therefore a very serious charge.\n",
      "It's important to note that we haven't heard the other side of the story. But it appears that whistleblowers have come forward - and have been listened to.\n",
      "Against that background, the dismissal should come as no surprise.\n",
      "A report last year by the Royal Aeronautical Society into discrimination and lack of diversity in airline pilot training found \"extremely concerning\" reports of sexism and sexual harassment by many female pilots.\n",
      "Although many had positive comments on their training, reports of sexism and harassment ranged from \"banter\" to \"uncomfortable advances from male trainers\".\n",

      "Vivo X90s Officially Teased, Tipped to Run on New MediaTek Dimensity 9200+ SoC: Vivo X90s has been teased by Jia Jingdong, Vivo's Vice President and General Manager of Product Strategy via Weibo on Thursday. The new smartphone has a design similar to its Vivo X90 series siblings — Vivo X90 and Vivo X90 Pro. The Vivo X90s is shown to have a Zeiss-tuned triple rear camera unit. The upcoming model is expected to retain the key specification of the Vivo X90. Meanwhile, Chinese tipsters have leaked the specifications of the upcoming handset. The Vivo X90s is said to run on MediaTek Dimensity 9200+ SoC and could be offered in four different colour options.\n",
      "Jia Jingdong posted an image of the Vivo X90s on the Chinese microblogging platform providing us a glimpse of the design from the rear. The render shows the handset in a white finish with rounded corners. The image suggests Zeiss branded triple rear cameras on the rear panel along with an LED flash. It seems to have a glass back with the Vivo branding at the bottom.\n",
      "Vivo, however, didn't confirm the exact launch date or key specifications of the Vivo X90s.\n",
      "Separately, several Chinese tipsters posted specifications of the upcoming Vivo X90s on Weibo. According to the tipsters, the handset will be powered by the latest MediaTek Dimensity 9200+ SoC. This would be an upgrade over the MediaTek Dimensity 9200 SoC found on the vanilla Vivo X90. The new model is said to offer Wi-Fi 7 connectivity and could be offered in black, blue, green, red, and white colour options. The Vivo X90, in contrast, has Wi-Fi 6 and is available in China Red, Ice Blue, and Original Black (translated from Chinese) in China.\n",
      "A TENAA listing from May revealed the specifications of the Vivo X90s. As per the listing, it will have a 6.78-inch 1.5K (1,280 x 2,800 pixels) curved AMOLED display. The screen has a centre-aligned hole-punch cutout at the top. It is listed to carry up to 16GB of RAM along with up to 1TB of inbuilt storage.\n",

      "NEW YORK, June 15, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Bank of America today announced that it has committed more than $500 million in equity investments to minority- and women-led funds, more than doubling its initial $200 million commitment.\n",
      "The bank has committed equity to more than 150 funds, which to date have invested in over 1,000 companies that span 40 states. These companies are led by 1,500 diverse entrepreneurs and employ over 21,000 people.\n",
      "\"We work across our company to address critical needs in our communities, including the lack of access to capital that diverse business owners face as they start or grow their businesses,\" said Tram Nguyen, Global Head of Strategic and Sustainable Investments at Bank of America. \"We want to empower the talented fund managers who keenly understand how to identify and support those business owners. Each time we support a minority- or women-led fund, they in turn support diverse entrepreneurs, which ultimately helps us toward achieving our goal to advance racial equality and economic opportunity.\"\n",
      "Not only are fund managers breaking down barriers themselves, but they are also investing in companies looking to catalyze change. As a graduate of a Historically Black College and University (HBCU), Nasir Qadree founded Zeal to provide overlooked founders with the resources they need to scale towards their next stage of growth. This includes being an early investor in Esusu, now one of the few Black-owned unicorns, which provides tools to help immigrants and minorities to provide rent reporting and data solutions for credit building.\n",
      "Chingona Ventures, led by General Partner Samara Hernandez, was the only active fund in the Midwest started and led by a Latina at the time of Bank of America's investment.

      "The selloff comes after Chief Financial Officer John Rex said late Tuesday at a Goldman Sachs investor conference that there were indications of \"pent-up demand\" from senior citizens to have hip and knee procedures and cardiology checkups, which could hurt results from UnitedHealth's Medicare business.\n",
      "Oppenheimer analyst Michael Wiederhorn said while other insurers that presented at recent conferences didn't mention similar trends, he believed UnitedHealth's comments will weigh on the entire sector.\n",
      "He said rival Humana Inc. (HUM) was potentially the most exposed, given its larger Medicare Advantage presence. And on cue, Humana's stock was the S&P 500's biggest decliner, tumbling 13.8%.\n",
      "Some of the S&P 500's other big losers were also in the Medicare Advantage business, as Centene Corp.'s (CNC) stock sank 6.9%, Elevance Health Inc. (ELV) shares shed 6.8% and CVS Health Corp.'s (CVS) stock slid 7.8%.\n",
      "UnitedHealth's stock has an outsized impact on the Dow's price\n",
      "UnitedHealth's stock is the highest-priced component of the Dow, which is a price-weighted index, unlike the S&P 500, which is a market-capitalization-weighted index. That means the stock's moves affect the Dow more than any other component.\n",
      "At Wednesday's closing prices, a 1% move in UnitedHealth's stock represents about a 30-point move in the Dow, while a 1% move in Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.'s (WBA) stock, which is the lowest priced, has about a 2-point effect on the Dow.\n",

      "Houston Texans Come To Terms With Ex-Third-Round Pick Defensive Tackle: KEY POINTS\n",
      "The Texans have signed Maliek Collins to a two-year deal\n",
      "Collins becomes latest defensive player to settle a contract with a mother team\n",
      "J.J. Watt has yet to properly file his retirement with the NFL\n",
      "The Houston Texans have ramped up their defensive needs with the reported signing of Maliek Collins on Wednesday, June 14.\n",
      "According to Adam Schefter of ESPN, both sides sealed the deal on a contract extension with Collins accepting a $23 million contract extension.\n",
      "\"The deal was negotiated by Texans' GM Nick Caserio and director of football administration Andrew Brown with Collins' agents Drew Rosenhaus and Ryan Matha,\" the scribe wrote on his Twitter post\n",
      "The new deal gives Collins a bit of a raise and reportedly includes a $20 million guarantee.\n",
      "In his previous contract, the 28-year-old was earning $17 million with $8.5 million of that guaranteed.\n",
      "This will be his third year in the NFL, having had previous stops with the Dallas Cowboys (2016-2019) and the Las Vegas Raiders (2020).\n",
      "The Kansas native had a career-high 37 tackles to go with 3.5 sacks over 15 games last NFL season.\n",
      "He is projected to be a key piece in the defensive line of the Texans for the next couple of years.\n",
      "Looking ahead, Collins is expected to fit in nicely with the 4-3 alignment that DeMeco Ryans is expected to implement.\n",
      "He is likely to become a full-time defensive tackle according to Sam Robison of Pro Football Talk.\n",
      "With the Texans in rebuilding mode, Collins was seen as one of the bright spots for the team. He started 15 games between 2021 and 2022, combining for six sacks and 18 tackles for a loss.\n",
      "Now, he will be paid better, which means he will have added responsibility–particularly on the defensive side of the Texans' fence.\n",
      "The Collins deal also comes not long after other defensive tackles landed new deals with their respective teams. That list includes Dexter Lawrence, Daron Payne, Jeffery Simmons and Ed Oliver.\n",
      "There are still other names expected to land new contracts this NFL offseason. Yet to come to terms with their teams include Chris Jones of the Kansas City Chiefs and Quinnen Williams of the New York Jets.\n",
      "In related news, there remain questions in the air on whether J.J. Watt is officially retired.\n",
      "According to a report by CBS Sports, Watt has yet to fill out his retirement papers with the NFL.\n",
      "This was despite his retiring last NFL season in an emotional game that saw him record two sacks in his allegedly final NFL game.\n",
      "Moreover, the five-time first-team All-Pro does not intend to sign a one-day deal with the Texans although this is tied to him being inducted into the club's Ring of Honor.\n",
      "\"I personally just don't really understand or see the reason for it,\" Watt stated. \"It's more just a ceremonial piece of paper. I think that the Ring of Honor and all that comes with it is more than enough.\"\n",
      "NFL Rumors: What Patriots ‘Made Clear’ To DeAndre Hopkins’ Reps: The Patriots apparently didn’t waste any time courting DeAndre Hopkins once he hit the open market.\n",
      "Hopkins officially became an NFL free agent when he was released by the Arizona Cardinals on May 26. Around that juncture, New England reportedly reached out to the star wide receiver’s team to express interest. Those conversations birthed a free-agent visit, which reportedly started Wednesday in Foxboro, Mass. and carried into Thursday morning.\n",
      "“I just got official word: DeAndre Hopkins is in New England,” NFL insider Jeremy Fowler said Thursday on ESPN’s “Get Up.” “He’s meeting with the Patriots. He will meet with the coaches, Bill Belichick. The Patriots’ interest remains high. They made that clear with Hopkins’ representatives from the very beginning when he became a free agent. So, we’ll see if they can close on this thing.”\n",
      "Hopkins has received co-signs from New England team leaders like Mac Jones and Matthew Judon, and the Patriots reportedly are optimistic they can add the five-time Pro Bowl selection. But even if Hopkins’ meeting with the Patriots goes well, don’t be surprised if the 31-year-old leaves New England without a deal.\n",
      "“I’m also told Hopkins (is) not in a major rush,” Fowler said. “He’s looking at more of training camp, even early August as more of a harder deadline for him to sign somewhere. So, it would have to be a very sweet offer for New England to make that happen today.”\n",
      "The Patriots appear to be the second team Hopkins met with as a free agent. Prior to his trip to New England, the veteran pass-catcher talked shop with the Titans in Nashville.\n",

      "State Street (NYSE:STT) shareholders have endured a 13% loss from investing in the stock five years ago: In order to justify the effort of selecting individual stocks, it's worth striving to beat the returns from a market index fund. But even the best stock picker will only win with some selections. So we wouldn't blame long term State Street Corporation (NYSE:STT) shareholders for doubting their decision to hold, with the stock down 25% over a half decade. In contrast, the stock price has popped 9.8% in the last thirty days. However, this may be a matter of broader market optimism, since stocks are up 6.8% in the same time.\n",

      "To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\n",
      "During the unfortunate half decade during which the share price slipped, State Street actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) improve by 6.1% per year. So it doesn't seem like EPS is a great guide to understanding how the market is valuing the stock. Alternatively, growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past.\n",
      "Because of the sharp contrast between the EPS growth rate and the share price growth, we're inclined to look to other metrics to understand the changing market sentiment around the stock.\n",

The user, who goes by profile name ‘gsratta’ on Team-bhp forum, said that he received a text message from Paytm stating that his Fastag has been blacklisted due to insufficient balance.

However, the recent incidents have raised concerns about the reliability of the system.

      "The New York John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK)-based carrier revealed the new livery in a Twitter video, calling the new design a livery that got “a fresh bold look just like the moves we’ve been making as a travel company”.\n",
      "In a separate press release, the airline explained that it has always “made big bold moves – and we’re matching those with a big bold update to our iconic liveries, with a blue allover fuselage, refreshed (and refreshing) accent colors, energized tailfin patterns that extend onto the body and belly, and more”.\n",
      "According to JetBlue, the first aircraft to bear the new livery will be named “A Defining MoMint”. The Airbus A321, registered as N982JB, was delivered to the airline new in August 2017. Flightradar24.com data showed that the A321 was at Macon Middle Georgia Regional Airport (MCN), Georgia, United States (US) between May 29 and June 14, 2023, when it flew back to JFK.\n",
      "Since then, the aircraft operated a round-trip itinerary to San Francisco International Airport (SFO), with another round-trip journey planned to SFO on June 15, 2023. Following the flight to SFO, however, the Airbus A321 is scheduled to fly to Las Vegas Harry Reid International Airport (LAS).\n",
